* Objectives

Data science is concerned with getting data to work for us, to give us
its (presumed) hidden treasures. Data science has been called "the
sexiest job of the 21st century". Even if you don't want to become a
professonial data scientist, it's helpful to master the basic concepts
if you want to succeed in today's data-driven business.

This course focuses on visualizing data. There are many tools and
platforms out there to visualize patterns found in data and tell
engaging, convincing stories. As a data scientist, you have to know
what's out there, understand the principles of good visual
presentation, and be able to customize plots quickly.

In this course, we look at popular platforms like Tableau and R Shiny,
and at different packages within R.

* Target audience

The course is for anyone who is interested in becoming more data
literate in their own field of interest - be it languages, theatre,
biology, psychology or exercise science - and growing their personal
skill stack.

Visualization of data-driven insights and improved productivity when
working with data and media is a concern for any professional.

In this course, we use R (and some Python), which is easier to learn
for students outside of computer science.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete "Data visualization" (DSC 302) will be
able to:

- Learn about, and use popular data science visualization platforms
- Understand how to visualiye exploratory data analysis results
- Apply literate programming principles to their work with Org-mode
- Use infrastructure including command line, Emacs, and GitHub
- Develop their critical thinking skills
- Know how to effectively present assignment and project results

This introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis prepares course
participants for taking DSC 305, "Machine learning".

* Course requirements

Introduction to programming (CSC 100 or CSC 115). Some knowledge of,
and experience with programming and using the R language is useful but
not critical. Curiosity is essential. You will gain data literacy
skills by taking this course. The course will prepare you for further
studies in computer and data science, or in other disciplines that use
modern computing, i.e. every discipline, from accounting to zoology).

* Grading system

| WHEN    | DESCRIPTION             | IMPACT |
|---------+-------------------------+--------|
| Weekly  | Programming assignments |    25% |
| Monthly | Sprint reviews          |    25% |
| Weekly  | Tests                   |    25% |
| TBD     | Final exam (optional)   |    25% |

- Sprint reviews are monthly project progress reports
- Tests are open-book multiple choice exams for home
- The final exam is optional if you want to improve your grade
