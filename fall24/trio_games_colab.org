4) Simple programs: "Hello World" and user input/output.
5) Quiz 1.
6) Python loops and conditional statements.
7) Random numbers.
8) Write and understand a simple game.
9) Quiz 2.
10) What do to next.

** Why should you (still) learn how to program?

- Programming is fun.
- Programming is a useful skill to have.
- Programming trains your brain to think logically.
- Programming gets you used to making and fixing mistakes.

** Will AI not do all the programming for us?

"So much of what we do as software developers is just magic to
people. It's really hard for people outside of software to gauge how
complicated some tasks are, or what software is capable and not
capable of doing. So AI just seems magical, but I have a really dim
and critical view of ChatGPT and a lot of these large language models
and various tools. It's not like blockchain or NFTs. There is
something there, but there is also just so much hype surrounding these
tools. So what I have to tell people is, yes, it absolutely is worth
it to learn how to program."

Al Sweigart ([[https://the-stack-overflow-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes/spreading-the-gospel-of-python/transcript][Stackoverflow.com podcast, May 24, 2024]])

** Getting started with IPython

- IPython is a Python /shell/ program - an environment to connect to the
  Python interpreter. It's not the same as

- The Python interpreter takes your commands and executes them
  directly.

- Alternatively, you must download and install the Python interpreter
  on your personal computer (from python.org).

- If you have Python on your PC, you can open a command line (CMD) and
  open the interpreter (aka console or shell) with the command
  =python3=.

- The '3' suggests that there was a 'python2': on many computers,
  entering =python= will start Python 2 instead of Python 3.

- Confusingly, Python 2 and Python 3 are not compatible.

** Getting started with IDLE

- When you have Python, you also have another program called IDLE,
  which can be started from the command line with =idle=.

- IDLE (Interactive DeveLopment Environment) is like a word processor
  for writing Python programs.

- It's a separate window where you can enter commands and execute
  them.

- IDLE is a so-called "Integrated Development Environment" (IDE) that
  allows you to perform different operations during program
  development on one platform: writing, debugging and executing code.

** Getting started with Google Colaboratory

- Fortunately, Google offers a free IPython application called
  Colaboratory, which we will use to do all of our coding.

- To open, you must have a Google account. In a browser (any will do
  but Google Chrome works best), open =colab.research.google.com=.

- In this notebook, you can add text and code, and you can run the code.

- To experiment with that, open a new notebook from the =File= menu and
  code alongside me.

- The text can be formatted using so-called Markdown language:
  - =#= will create a headline and a section
  - =##= will create a headline and a subsection
  - =` `= will format text as code
  - =![img](URL)= will load an image from the address URL
  - etc.

- =CTRL + ENTER= will execute a code cell, and =SHIFT + ENTER= will
  execute it and create a new code cell.

- Examples:
  1. Create a text cell with the headline "My first text cell"
  2. Create another text cell with the sub-headline "My first code cell"
  3. Create a code cell
  4. In the code cell, type this code & run it with SHIFT + ENTER
     #+begin_example python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     #+end_example
  5. In the next code cell, type this code & run it with CTRL + ENTER:
     #+begin_example python
     plt.plot([1,2,3,4])
     plt.ylabel('some numbers')
     plt.show()
     #+end_example

- You now have all the ingredients of an interactive data science
  notebook: text, code, and output.

- Give the notebook a title, e.g. "Colabdemo.ipynb" and save it. This
  file will now automatically be saved to your Google Drive account.

** Getting started with Python

- At the top of the welcome screen, you find the =File= menu: open it
  and choose =Upload notebook=, then browse your PC to upload the file
  =trio.ipynb= that you downloaded at the start.

- The notebook contains all the text from my own notebook, with little
  exercises and space for you to code along.


* Manipulating values

** Manipulating integer values

We'll start by learning how to manipulate numbers ('arithmetic').

- In the code block, execute the operation `2 + 2` (`CTRL + ENTER`).
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- In the next code block, write `2 + 2` on one line, and `2 - 2` on
  the next line, then execute the block:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    
  #+end_src

- [In Colab] Where did the first result go? Answer: you need to use
  =print= for every expression that you want to print out, otherwise
  only the last one evaluated will be shown.

** Using operators, floats, integers

- You can add, subtract, multiply and divide in Python.
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- The first line above uses scientific notation for large numbers:
  `1e3` is `10 * 10 * 10 = 1000`, and `1e-3` is `1 / (10 * 10 * 10) =
  1/1000` or `0.001`.

- Both operations result in a decimal (or floating-point) number
  (`1.0`), or /float/, rather than a whole (or integer) number (`1`).

- A number like `1` or `2.0` is a /value/. A math problem like `2 + 2`
  is an /expression/. Expressions are made up of values connected by
  operators (`+`).

- The computer is obsessed with evaluating expressions. In the next
  code block, evaluate some expressions and `print` the results:
  1) `2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2`
  2) `8*6`
  3) `10 - 5 + 6`
  4) `2 +          2`
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- When an expression is evaluated, Python has to observe an order of
  operations ("P+E+MD+AS"). The expression is always evaluated to a
  single value
  
- Run the first line of the code in a code block and `print` the
  result:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- Test question: Will the following expressions give the same or
  different results? Take a guess before running the cell!
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(8 * 3 / 2 + 2 + 7 - 9)
    print(2 + 7 - 9 + 8 * 3 / 2)
    print(2 + 7 - 9 + 8 * (3 / 2))
    print(2 + 8 * (3 / 2) + 7 - 9)
  #+end_src

** Making syntax errors

- Entering ` 5 + ` generates a `SyntaxError` because the `+` operator
  is binary and requires two arguments on either side:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- Syntax errors result from not observing the rules of the language -
  it's as if Yoda was saying "Home I go". This violates the SPO rule
  of English syntax - Subject + Predicate + Object.

- The difference between humans and machines: we can often, the
  computer can never recover from syntax errors.

** Storing values in variables

- A variable is like a box that can hold a value.

- In the next code block, store the integer number `15` in a variable
  called `spam`[fn:1].
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results silent

  #+end_src

- You've just written a /statement/ or more specifically an /assignment
  statement/ using the assignment operator `=`. There's no output until
  you ask for the value stored in `spam`.
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- Python is case-sensitive, i.e. `SPAM` is different from `spam` or
  from `Spam`. You can test that by printing all of these:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- The last two attempts result in a `NameError` because these
  variables were `not defined`, i.e. they were never assigned values.

** Computing with variables

- Once a variable is defined, you can use it to compute. In the next
  code block, `print` the expressions `spam + 5` and `spam * spam`:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- In fact, you don't need two lines for this: put both expressions in
  the same `print` command:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- Now change the value of `spam` to `3` and print the expressions
  again:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- Do you think it's possible to do all of that in the `print` command,
  like this:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- You encounter a third kind of error, a `TypeError`: inside `print`,
  `spam` is not recognized as part of `spam = 3`.

- However, if you change the `=` in the last command to a `==`, the
  code works:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- This is because now you're printing a /value/ as required by Python,
  the value is `True` because `spam` is actually equal to `3`. The
  `==` is a relational operator. It tests the equality of its left and
  its right hand operand.

- In the next code block, first alter the value of `spam` by adding
  `2` to itself like this: `spam = spam + 2`. In the following line,
  repeat the previous `print` command:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- Now, `spam == 3` is `False`, because the new value is 3 + 2 = 5.

- In the next code block, define two more variables, `bacon` with the
  value `10`, and `eggs` with the value `15`.
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results silent

  #+end_src

- Enter `spam = bacon + eggs` in the next code block, then check the
  value of `spam`:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

** Summary I

- Expressions are values like `2` or `5.0` combined with operators
  like `+` or `/`.
- Expressions are evaluated and reduced to a single value.
- Values can be stored in variables to be remembered and used later.
- Python errors include `SyntaxError`, `TypeError` and `NameError`.

* Writing programs

** Using string values

- In Python, text values are called /strings/. They can be used just
  like integer or float values, and you can store them in variables.

- Python recognizes text values when they are enclosed in (single or
  double) quotation marks: `"spam"` is a string, `spam` is a variable.

- Store the string `hello` in the variable `spam`, then `print` it:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- Strings can have any keyboard character in them and they can be as
  long as you like:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print("ijdinfnns d    \n   ***&&^6///34/$$$\n\
    once upon the time in a galaxy far, far away..."x)
  #+end_src

- In the last example, Python recognized two special characters: `\n`
  (new line) and `\` (continue here).

- Strings can be /concatenated/: enter `'Hello' + 'World!'` in the next
  code block:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- What's behind this? All values have a /data type/ (integer, float,
  string, or Boolean), and the `+` operator works differently on them:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

** Creating the Hello World program

- It's traditional for programmers to make their first program display
  `Hello world!` on the screen[fn:2]

- Enter the following code in the code block:
  1. `# This program says hello and asks for my name`
  2. `print('Hello world!')`
  3. `print('What is your name?')
  4. `name = input()`
  5. `print('It is good to meet you, ' + name)

  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results none

  #+end_src

- Let's analyze the program:
  1. This is a comment - Python ignores everything after `#`
  2. Displays a string on the screen - the program title.
  3. Displays a string on the screen - a question for the user.
  4. Asks for keyboard input and assigns it to the variable `name`.
  5. Concatenates the welcome and the value `name` of name & prints
     them.

- When you write your own programs, it is useful to add this information
  to the code using comments:
  #+begin_example python

  #+end_example

- In practice, you would first write the comments as a form of
  pseudocode, and/or put them in a process model. The more complicated
  a program is, and the more people are working on it, the more
  important it is that you follow these development practices!

- [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/org/master/fall24/img/hello.svg][Here is a BPMN Process model]] for the Hello world program (created at
  [[https://bpmn.io][bpmn.io]]).

** Getting input, printing output

- `print()` and `input()` are built-in functions.

- The value between the parentheses of a function is called its
  /argument/, like for mathematical functions $f(x)$.

- When the function is called, the argument is passed to the function
  for evaluation.

- Examples:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    # Print the string argument "hello world"

    # Print the number argument 2

    # Print the value of the expression 2 + 2
    
  #+end_src

- You can get short help on any function (or keyword) with the `help`
  function. In the next code block, pass the name of the `print`
  function as an argument to the `help` function:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- Do the same thing for `input`: get `help` using the `help` function
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- Both `help` texts contain a lot of technical information that you
  may not understand (yet). Especially when you encounter a new
  function, it's worth going down the rabbit hole of documentation to
  understand absolutely everything that the `help` can tell you.

- Here is the `input` command from the program again:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :tangle input.py :results silent
    name = input()
    print('Hello, ' + name)
  #+end_src

- What happens here? The function `input` is called without an
  argument. As the `help` explains, it reads "a string from standard
  input". Standard input (/stdin/) in this case means the keyboard.

- Standard input could also be passed to a Python script: after
  tangling the single command above as a Python file `input.py`, it
  can be run on the command line if `input` is a file containing
  input:
  #+begin_src bash :results output
    echo 'Marcus' > inputFile
    python3 input.py < inputFile
  #+end_src

** Forgetting and naming variables

- What happens to the variables when the program is finished?

- It depends:
  1) If you're working in an interactive notebook like an IPython
     shell, or in Emacs Org-mode, the variables are alive as long as
     the notebook session is running.
  2) If you run a program on the command line like `python3 input.py`
     above, everything is gone when the program is finished.

- Your variables have to be named by you. There are a few rules and
  recommendations for that:
  1) Don't start a name with anything but a (lowercase) letter
     (underscores are reserved, numbers or operators are not allowed)
  2) Observe the fact that variable names are case-sensitive: `SPAM`
     is not the same as `spam`.
  3) You must not have whitespace (empty characters) within the name.
  4) Variable names are usual lower case. You can form longer names
     either by connecting them with underscore `_` or with /camelCase/:
     for example: `my_number` or `myName`.

** Summary II

- All values have a data type (float, integer, string, or Boolean).
- Strings must be enclosed in single or double quotation marks.
- Strings can be concatenated with the `+` operator.
- Functions carry out complicated instructions, they are called with
  or without arguments, e.g. `print(2)` or `input()`.
- Functions can be used anywhere a value is used: `name=input()`.

** Quiz 1: Python Basics

* Writing a game program

** Defining the game

- We're going to bring the last few topics together in a complete
  little game script, a Guess the Number game.

- In this game, the computer will think of a secret number from 1 to
  20 and ask the user to guess it. After each guess, the computer will
  tell the user whether the number is too high or too low. The user
  wins if they can guess the number within six tries.

- The game uses many new Python tools:
  1) random numbers
  2) repeating code chunks
  3) grouping and indenting code
  4) selecting choices based on conditions
  5) converting values to different data types
  6) breaking out of loops

** Planning the game

- This example also demonstrates an exemplary solution path:
  1. Understand what's asked from you (*requirements*)
  2. Understand what the program needs from you (*input*)
  3. Understand what's the result supposed to look like (*output*)
  4. Plan the process without syntax (*pseudocode*)
  5. Create a process *diagram* (with commands)
  6. Code the Python program (*source code*)
  7. Run, test and debug the source code (*production code*)
  8. Fix pseudocode/diagram accordingly (*feedback*)
  9. Identify *extensions* (other things you might like)
  10. Implement extensions (repeat steps 4-8).

- When you run the program, [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/fall24/img/py_guessTheNumber_output.png][the output should look like this]].

- The program should generate a random number between 1 and 20.

- Enter the source code into the IDLE file editor, or into Colab, and
  save as `guessTheNumber.py`.

- Solution path/pseudocode (code highlighted)
  1) `import random` module.
  2) Generate a (secret) `random` number.
  3) Store number in variable `num`.
  4) Set `attempt` counter (number of guesses) to `0`.
  5) Get `input` number `guess` from user.
  6) Increase `attempt` by 1
  7) Check if `guess` is the same as `num`
  8) `print` success message and `attempt` value
  9) End program
  10) Otherwise, check if `guess` is smaller than `num`
  11) `print` information
  12) Otherwise, check if `guess` is larger than `num`
  13) `print` information
  14) Return to step 3

- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/fall24/img/py_guessTheNumber.png][The BPMN Process diagram is fairly complicated compared to the
  previous example.]] 

- Solution Python code (16 + 5 lines):
  #+begin_example python
    # import random module
    import random
    # pick random number between 1 and 20
    num = random.randint(1,20)
    # set attempts counter to 0
    attempt = 0
    # ask user for number guess
    print('Enter number between 1 and 20: ')
    # infinite loop until number is guessed
    while True:
        guess = int(input('Take a guess: '))
        attempt = attempt + 1
        if guess < num:
            print('Your guess is too low.')
            continue
        elif guess > num:
            print('Your guess is too high.')
            continue
        else:
            print('Good job! You guessed my number in ' + str(attempt) + ' guesses!')
            break
  #+end_example

** Generating random numbers

- To generate a secret guess, we use a (pseudo-) random number
  generator. In Python, such a generator is contained in the `random`
  package.

- To make this package available, you need to /install/ it to your
  computer and then /load/ it in the Python session where you need it.

- In Colab, the package is already installed and only has to be
  loaded with `import`:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results silent

  #+end_src

- We can now pick a random number between 1 and 20 using the `randint`
  function in `random`: run the following code multiple times to see
  how it works.
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- The `.` operator accesses the `random` package. You remember that we
  loaded a graphics package, `matplotlib.pyplot` earlier, and gave it
  an alias, `plt`[fn:3]:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results silent

  #+end_src

- To access the `plot` function in the package, we called the function
  twice: first to pass four points for plotting, and then to make the
  plot appear on the screen:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- You need randomness in many games - even board games use dice, and
  many game actions, e.g. by NPCs, are randomized.

** Repeating code

- The next part of the code that may be new to you if you never
  programmed before is the line ~while True:~

- This is an infinite loop: the ~while~ command enters the loop followed
  by a test. The generic form of the command is:
  #+begin_example
  while [test]:
      # do something
  #+end_example

- The result of the test is either `True` in which case the loop is
  entered, or `False`, in which case it is left again without doing
  anything.

- Let's look at a few examples:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- Let's analyze:
  1) Here, `i` is set to 1. When the `while` is encountered, `i < 5`
     is tested. Since it's `True`, the statements in the loop body are
     run: `i` is increased to 2, and printed.
  2) The loop is entered a second time: the test `2 < 5` is still
     `True`, `i` is increased to 3, and printed.
  3) The loop is entered a third time: the test `3 < 5` fails - it is
     evaluates to `False`, and the loop commands are not executed.

- As a challenge, change the `while` loop so that it starts at `i = 5`
  and tests if `i > 0`, so that the output is: `4 3 2 1 0`.
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- Coming back to our game: If the test reads `True` then the condition
  /never/ fails and the loop will keep running forever!

- To stop the game inside an infinite loop, we must take extra
  measures: we must `break` out of the loop.

- Here is an example: This loop runs exactly once and then exits
  because of the `break` command.
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    while True:
        print("Infinite loop!")
        break
    print("Done!")
  #+end_src

- The next one runs until `q` is entered. It prints the message to
  the screen and then halts waiting for input:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    while True:
        print("Infinite loop...until you type q")
        if input()=='q': break
        print("Done!")
  #+end_src

- The last example checks a condition after the `if` keyword: this is
  called a /conditional statement/. [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/org/master/fall24/img/conditional_statement.svg][Here is the BPMN process model.]]

** Checking conditions

- The core of the infinite game loop also has a conditional
  statement. Instead of one check, it has two: namely, if the user's
  guess, stored in `guess`, is greater or smaller than the computer's
  (secret) number:
  #+begin_example python
  if guess < num:
      print('Your guess is too low.')
      continue
  elif guess > num:
      print('Your guess is too high.')
      continue
  else:
      print('Good job! You guessed my number in ' + str(attempt) + ' guesses!')
      break
  #+end_example

This is what happens inside the loop:
1) If the guess is smaller than the computer's number, the user is
   told that it is, and we `continue` with another guess.
2) If the guess is greater than the computer's number, the user is
   told that it is, and we `continue` with another guess.
3) If the guess is neither smaller nor greater than the computer's
   number, we must have guessed it: then we print the result and
   `break` out of the loop to finish.

** Getting the user's number

- At the start of the loop, we get the user's guess and store it in
  the variable `guess`.

- We get this number from the keyboard with `input`:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results silent

  #+end_src

- You notice that we did not write `guess = input()`. Why? Let's see:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- When you run this code, you get a `TypeError`:
  #+begin_example python
  TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
  #+end_example

- The problem is that you cannot compare a string (`str`) and an
  integer (`int`) - and with `input` you can only import strings from
  the keyboard.

- To fix this, you must /convert/ the string to an integer. This only
  works, of course, if the converted string can be recognized as a
  number: it works for `"2"` but not for `"a"` or `"2 + 2"`:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- So `guess` holds not the string value of the user's number but the
  integer value, which can be compared with the computer's number.

** Printing the result

- Fortunately, we have already understood the concept of conversion:
  in the printout of the result, another conversion takes place, but
  this time the other way around, from integer to string:
  #+begin_example python
  print('Good job! You guessed my number in ' + str(attempt) + ' guesses!')
  #+end_example

- In the case of `str`, any number can be turned into a string:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- One way of testing if a value is a string or a number is by
  concatenating it with another string:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- As before, the second command fails with a `TypeError`:
  #+begin_example python
   TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "float") to str
  #+end_example

** Putting it all together

- In the next code block, let's assemble the whole program and run it:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output

  #+end_src

- You find yet another solution [[https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter3.html][in the textbook on page 22 (chapter 3)]].

** Program extensions and lessons learnt

- Program extensions:
  1) Make program safe against no/wrong input (exception handling):
     currently, it terminates with an error if a floating-point number
     or a letter or nothing is entered by mistake.
  2) Exchange the infinite `while` loop by a `for` loop with a set
     number of allowed guesses (most games don't go on forever).

- What's important to remember:
  1) For best productivity and learning, follow a solution path -
     don't just "code away"
  2) For best learning effects find different solutions to the same
     problem.
  3) For best results, handle exceptions. Balance exception handling
     with usability and performance.
  4) There is always more than one solution, usually many. There is no
     best solution to a programming problem that satisfies all
     requirements, even the unspoken ones, equally well.

** Summary III

- Expressions as part of an `if` or `while` statement are
  conditions. They evaluate to Boolean (truth) values.
- `break` and `continue` are flow control statements to break out of a
  loop or go back to the start of the loop.
- `print` and `input` serve the standard output (stdout) and the
  standard input (stdin) data stream, or output (e.g. to the screen)
  and input (e.g. from the keyboard).
- `int` and `str` are functions that convert strings and numbers into
  integers and strings, respectively.

** Quiz 2: Python Programming

* What to do next

- You've just completed the first three chapters of this book: "Invent
  Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th ed." by Al Sweigart

- The completed notebook for the course is available at
  tinyurl.com/trio-games-solution

- The whole book is (legally) freely available online:
  [[https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/][inventwithpython.com]]

- The book is the basis of a COR 100/Year One college course "Game
  Programming with Python".

- These books by the same author are great (not only) for beginners:
  1) [[https://automatetheboringstuff.com/][Automate the Boring Stuff with Python]] (2e, 2019)
  2) [[https://nostarch.com/crackingcodes][Cracking Codes with Python]] (2018)
  3) [[https://nostarch.com/beyond-basic-stuff-python][Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python]] (2020)

- All of them are also freely available online.

- freeCodeCamp.org has plenty of wonderful YouTube-based tutorials:
  you can use Google Colab to go through them and create your own
  notebooks as you learn!

- Lastly, I have created a Google Chat, `PythonGame`, which I will use
  for my "Game programming with Python" course this fall: let me know
  if you wish to be invited. I use this channel to share.

* Quizzes

Quizziz Library:
1) Python Basics Quiz (10 questions) - after the first session
2) Python Programming Quiz (8 questions) - after the second session

* Footnotes
[fn:3] Packages like `matplotlib` or `random` are also called
/libraries/, and sub-packages like `pyplot` in `matplotlib` are called
/modules/. Either of these three terms (package, library, module) will
do.

[fn:2]This goes back to the first proper programming manual written by
Kernighan and Ritchie for the C programming language, and it stuck
(this seminal book also bot its own [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language][Wikipedia page]]).

[fn:1]The use of `spam`, `ham`, `bacon` and `eggs` is an hommage to
the origin of the name for the Python language, the British comedy
group 'Monty Python' - see also their "Spam" sketch, which is so
famous that it has got its own [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(Monty_Python_sketch)][Wikipedia page]]!
