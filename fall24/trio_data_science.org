The inspiration and some of the content for this session comes from
Bradford Tuckfield's book "Dive into Data Science" (NoStarch, 2023).

The presented material is very similar to what you'll hear in my
"Introduction to data science" class (taught every fall at Lyon).


* What is data science?

* Why is data science so hot right now?

* What is literate programming?
