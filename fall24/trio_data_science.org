This file is available as an Emacs Org-mode notebook on the software
development platform GitHub at: [[https://tinyurl.com/trio-data-science][tinyurl.com/trio-data-science]]

The inspiration and some of the content for this session comes from
Bradford Tuckfield's book "Dive into Data Science" (NoStarch, 2023).

The presented material is very similar to what you'll hear in my
"Introduction to data science" class (taught every fall at Lyon).

Some of the slides come from Lyon's overview presentation on the
computer and data science program, see [[https://www.lyon.edu/data-science][www.lyon.edu/data-science]].

* Overview

1) What is data science and how is it done?
2) What is exploratory data analysis (EDA)?
3) What is a business scenario and why is it important?
4) How can you find patterns in datasets?
5) How can you store, import and display data with Python?
6) How can you calculate statistics and analyse data?
7) How can you draw and display simple plots?
8) How can you customize and improve plots?
9) How can you plot subsets of data?
10) How can you test different plot types?

* What is data science?

In terms of computer science and programming language, three languages
are indispensable for data scientists: R, Python, and SQL. You'll
learn all three of these (and many more) at Lyon College.

* Why is data science so hot right now?

*What do you think?*

Here is what I think:
#+begin_quote
1. The recent generative *AI hype* is based on transformers, deep
   machine learning models and natural language processing, which are
   part of (algorithmic) data science -> machine learning
2. The availability of *large datasets* and the relative ease of storing
   and processing the data when using fast computing equipment and
   networks -> databases
3. The desire to *automate* more and more simple processes so that
   humans can save their energy and brains to address complex problems
   -> robotics
4. The *commercial* interest of a small number of very large, very
   powerful tech companies that have smelled profits and ride the top
   of the hype wave (even though they also don't really know what's
   what). -> hype cycle
#+end_quote

* What is literate programming?

You've already seen it: it's the combination of data + code + stats
that enables you to tell a story about the data much more easily.

Today, you're going to use Google Colaboratory, an interactive notebook
application, to code alongside me. This is also how I always teach!

Open colab.research.google.com now and follow my lead to explore the
notebook capabilities:

1) Create a headline using markdown (~# headline~).
2) Format text as code, bold-face and italics.
3) Add code blocks and edit source code.
4) Execute code blocks and generate output on the fly.

The notebook saves you enormous amounts of work related to the often
complicated infrastructure when pursuing data science projects:
- Mastering the file system (where everything is stored on the PC)
- Mastering the shell (connection to the operating system)
- Mastering the installation of libraries
- Mastering the control of graphics
- Getting coding help

You will still have to learn all these things, but not on this day!

In short, literate programming is the usual way in which data
scientists explore data and build reports for humans by combining
documentation, code, and output.

* Exploring and analysing data

- /Exploratory Data Analysis/ means using different tools to look at the
  data in as much detail as possible to understand
  1) where the data come from
  2) how large is the dataset
  3) what the data contain
  4) what the data mean
  5) what quality the data have
  6) what format the data have
  7) what information might be obtained from the data
  8) what the logical next step(s) could be

- Suppose that someone gives you the following dataset:
  #+begin_example

  #+end_example

- Can you make sense of the data at all? (Without external help.)

- What we can say about the data without further exploration:
  #+begin_quote
  1. The first line looks different from all the other lines.
  2. The dataset consists of 33 lines, 566 words, and 1766 characters.
  3. It contains text, integer and decimal numbers.
  4. The first word in the last 32 lines could be the name of a car.
  5. All items in the dataset are separated by commas.
  #+end_quote

- What can we infer from these observations?
  #+begin_quote
  1) ~mtcars~ has a headline and 32 records.
  2) ~mtcars~ data are stored as a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file.
  3) ~mtcars~ contains data about different car models.
  4) ~mtcars~ contains data about car ~model,~ miles-per-gallon (~mpg~),
     horsepower (~hp~), automatic/manual (~am~), number of gears (~gear~).
  #+end_quote

- Where do the data come from?
  #+begin_quote
  ~mtcars~ is a built-in dataset from the base version of the R
  language. I obtained the data [[https://gist.githubusercontent.com/seankross/a412dfbd88b3db70b74b/raw/5f23f993cd87c283ce766e7ac6b329ee7cc2e1d1/mtcars.csv][from GitHub]]. The data was supposedly
  "extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel
  consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for
  32 automobiles (1973-1974 models)." (Source: [[https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html][stat.ethz.ch]]). You can
  easily find good and bad EDA examples with ~mtcars~[fn:1].
  #+end_quote

- In the case of ~mtcars~, we can answer all these questions by just
  looking at the entire dataset. But real datasets are rarely this
  small, which is why we need tools to help us explore the data.

- How does "exploration" differ from "analysis"? And does it matter?
  #+begin_quote
  *"Exploration"* comes from the Latin word 'explorare', which means 'to
  call out' when searching or to seek information.

  *"Analysis"*, Greek "ἀνάλυσις" (análisis), means breaking something up
  or dissolving it in order to understand the whole through its parts.

  EDA then is short for seeking out information by looking at details
  of the data. This will give you insights but an important so-called
  *"Gestalt"* (German for 'shape') principle says that "the whole is
  more than the sum of its parts" - analysis is followed by synthesis
  where you put the parts together again after having understood them.

  It is perhaps important to note that the process of gaining insights
  through dissection followed by re-composition works well for
  machines but not so well for organic entities like humans, or their
  most precious properties - a brain, or a thought, do not lend
  themselves easily to such a simple procedure.

  Or put differently, you may not find out what you really want to
  know by EDA. But that's another topic for another day.
  #+end_quote

* Devising a business scenario

- Though we found out where the ~mtcars~ dataset comes from, it's
  removed from us in time and meaning: we're not readers of the 1970s
  magazine, most of us don't drive these classic cars, and some may
  not even care about cars at all!

- Why does this matter?
  #+begin_quote
  Direct knowledge of the data matters because it helps you imbue the
  data with meaning. Data aren't like atoms, they're more like story
  particles that form patterns, which you have to discover and
  interpret.
  #+end_quote

- Instead of ~mtcars~, we start with a different scenario that you may
  be more familiar with:
  #+begin_quote
  You've joined a company, BikeShare Inc, which rents bicycles to
  people to ride around the city. The goals of the company are the
  same as for other companies. They include customer satisfaction,
  employee morale, brand recognition, market share, cost reduction,
  and revenue growth. You could probably find this company and its
  business locations on the "[[https://bikesharingworldmap.com/#/all/2.1/0/37.37/][Bike-sharing World Map]]" (I bet you didn't
  know that such a map existed).
  #+end_quote
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  [[./img/bike_sharing_map.png]]

- For our purpose of EDA, these goals correspond to /metrics/, entities
  that can be measured (at least indirectly): we can't know if
  customers are really satisfied but we can make them fill in a
  survey, and we don't know 'employee morale' directly but we can
  measure how many employees stay with the company for how long, etc.

- Your mission is to pick an area to attend to in order to improve the
  performance of the company[fn:2]. You've decided to dive into the
  data yourself to understand better how the company works (and where
  it could be run better).

- What you've just heard is a *business scenario*, or a *narrative*, a
  background *story* that gives meaning to the data. A side effect is
  that you care more about the data than you would if you had no
  idea[fn:3]

* Finding patterns in Datasets

- You can download real bike-sharing data from here:
  [[https://tinyurl.com/hour-csv][tinyurl.com/hour-csv]][fn:4]
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  [[./img/capital_bikeshare.png]]

- Take a look at the data (not the map): what do you see?
  #+begin_quote
  Multiple *metrics* (measures) are visible in the headline. All data
  seem to be either *numbers* (integer and decimal) or *dates*. There are
  17,379 records (or rows). The dataset is much too large to be
  analyzed by the naked eye alone. The format of the dataset is CSV,
  *Comma-Separated-Values*: the values are separated by commas.
  #+end_quote

- You can look at the data with a spreadsheet application, e.g. Google
  Sheets: [[https://tinyurl.com/hours-sheets][tinyurl.com/hours-sheets]]. Now, the columns are easily
  distinguishable but the data is not easier to manage.

- *What does the dataset represent?*
  1) Each row of the dataset represents information about a particular
     hour between 12 am on Jan-1-2011 and 11:59 pm on Dec-31-2012 -
     more than 17,000 hours.
  2) Each column of the dataset shows a particular metric measured for
     each of these hours, e.g. wind speed measured at a particular
     weather station
  3) The data have been transformed: for example, wind speed has been
     transformed from miles-per-hour to a number in (0,1) so that 0
     corresponds to no wind, and 1 to fast wind speed.
  4) The last three columns are the most important ones for the
     company - the number of people who used the bikes each hour:

     | ~casual~     | people who used bikes without registering      |
     | ~registered~ | people who register for discounts and benefits |
     | ~count~      | total number of people who used bikes          |

- Look at the data again (only the first 24 hours) to see if you can
  discern any patterns in these customer related columns:
  #+attr_html: :width 650px:
  [[./img/hours_spread.png]]
  #+begin_quote
  1. The number of ~registered~ users is mostly greater than the number
     of ~casual~ users.
  2. The two groups peak at slightly different times (1 pm vs. 2 pm).
  #+end_quote

- As CEO, what could you do with insights like these?
  #+begin_quote
  1. This could mean that using the service casually isn't as easy as
     it could be to increase casual users.
  2. This could indicate demographic differences between the groups
     (e.g. age), suggesting different marketing approaches.
  #+end_quote

- Just by looking at a few columns of the first day of the data, we
  have already learnt a few things about the company and are starting
  to get some business ideas. No math, (almost) no tools, just common
  sense so far!

* Using CSV to store data

- The data that you see in the CSV file [[https://tinyurl.com/hour-csv][tinyurl.com/hour-csv]] are
  called "raw" data though they're minimally formatted already,
  because every data item is a character of text.

- What does the spreadsheet add to this?
  #+begin_quote
  1. Alignment in columns for readability
  2. Flexibility in moving the columns around for better viewing
  3. Computations on numerical data
  4. Opening depends on available (commercial) spreadsheet software
  #+end_quote

- The advantage of CSV:
  1. Files can be easily created
  2. Files can be easily opened by many different programs
  3. Data can easily be changed
  4. Files are small, portable, easy to share

* Code along using Google Colab

- Now, open your browser to the following address:

- Code along with me in the interactive notebook.

* Displaying data with Python

To display the data in a different way and open it up for analysis, we
import them into Python.

- *Python* is not the only but an obvious choice: it's a FOSS language
  that can easily be learnt and that is widespread (in fact the most
  popular among all high level programming languages)[fn:5].

- *What does "import into Python" mean?* It means that we *read* the CSV
  data into a format that will allow us to use Python's advanced
  functionality to explore further and analyse more thoroughly.

- *Advanced functionality* means that Python has /functions/, pre-written
  sets of instructions that can compute new quantities for us: for
  example an average over many values, or create a graph showing us
  the evolution of a quantity (like count) over time.

- These are the steps required to display the data using Python:
  1) *install* a Python library
  2) *import* the Python library
  3) *read* the CSV file into Python's format
  4) *store* the Python-formatted file in a Python object
  5) *print* the Python object to the screen

- *Why so many steps?* Each of these has a reason:
  1) *Install*: Extra functionality are not contained in base Python: if you want
     to do special things, you need special tools.
  2) *Import*: Python is interactive - you need to make the library,
     which you now have on your computer, available in the current
     Python session.
  3) *Read*: The imported Python library has a special function that can
     understand CSV and spit it out in the format Python needs.
  4) *Print*: Python has a built-in function to display data.

- In summary, the multi-step process is owed to the fact that there
  are many interlocking parts to achieve something that seems simple
  to the unsuspecting user. The prize is having a lot of power over
  how to display and analyse the data.

- Here's the code to achieve this[fn:6]:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    import pandas as pd
    hour = pd.read_csv('https://tinyurl.com/hour-csv')
    print(hour.head())
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :    instant      dteday  season  yr  ...  windspeed  casual  registered  count
  : 0        1  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       3          13     16
  : 1        2  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       8          32     40
  : 2        3  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       5          27     32
  : 3        4  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       3          10     13
  : 4        5  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       0           1      1
  :
  : [5 rows x 17 columns]

- Let's dissect the code: it is important, now and forever, that you
  understand every detail of your code down, every character, its
  position and meaning[fn:7].

- It is useful (especially at the start) to add the explanation to the
  code in the code block in the form of comments that Python ignores:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    ##################################################
    # Python script to display the top of a CSV file #
    ##################################################

    # Import the pandas library and alias it as pd
    import pandas as pd

    # Read CSV file from its location and store data in a DataFrame
    hour = pd.read_csv('data/hour.csv')

    # Print the top of the DataFrame
    print(hour.head())
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :    instant      dteday  season  yr  ...  windspeed  casual  registered  count
  : 0        1  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       3          13     16
  : 1        2  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       8          32     40
  : 2        3  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       5          27     32
  : 3        4  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       3          10     13
  : 4        5  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       0           1      1
  :
  : [5 rows x 17 columns]

- I introduced a few additional things:
  1. =DataFrame= is the format of the Python =pandas= library for tabular data
  2. When reading data, the computer needs to be given an exact
     location. On my computer, the CSV file is in the directory =data=,
     so I need to specify ~data/hours.csv~ for it to be found.
  3. Aliasing the =pandas= library as =pd= means that anything that's in
     the library must be addressed using =pd=. =read_csv= is a /method/ (or
     function) inside the library. For the computer to find it, I must
     write =pd.read_csv=. If I only wrote =read_csv=, I'd get an error.
  4. I assigned the data to a =pandas= =DataFrame= named ~hours~: If I want
     to use =pandas= functions on ~hours~, I need to tell the computer
     that, too: I must write ~hours.head~ to let it know that I want to
     run =head= on ~hours~. If I only wrote =head=, I'd get an error.

- You should try it for yourself and see what happens if you violate
  these rules. You can see that even the simplest of operations
  requires an enormous amount of background knowledge. You cannot
  really do without it but you also don't have to learn it all on one
  day.

- We could have saved ourselves the use of =head= and simply written
  ~print(hour~) - but that would have given us a display of the whole
  dataset, which is huge (you should try this, too).

- How does the output compare to the CSV file and the spreadsheet?
  1. Data is arranged by column similar to the spreadsheet
  2. Some columns in the middle are left out and replaced by ellipses
  3. Only the first five rows are displayed plus the headline

* Calculating summary statistics

- Summary statistics are mathematical functions that reveal
  properties, which make the more sense the more data we have.

- Such properties include the average, the median, the maximum, the
  minimum, and the standard deviation. Here, we will not go into the
  math (it's not difficult) but only present code and results.

- Begin by calculating the mean of one of the columns, ~count~:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(hour['count'].mean())
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 189.46308763450142

- The command follows the same rule as ~hour.head()~ earlier: this time,
  we apply the function =mean=, which computes the average - but it
  makes no sense to average the whole table: ~hour['count']~ selects
  only the ~count~ column out of the table and average over its values.

- Since we don't need this level of precision (this many numbers after
  the decimal point), let's store the average in a variable ~mean~ and
  print it with 2 decimals after the decimal point:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    mean = hour['count'].mean()
    print(f'{mean:.2f}')
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 189.46

- So in 2011-2012, 189.46 bikes were taken out per hour. This gives us
  an idea of the size of the business. According to their website, a
  single ride with Capital bikeshare cost $0.05 per minute (or $3 per
  hour): the average hourly revenue is therefore 189.46 x $3 =
  $568.388, or almost $5 mio per year. This is not the business
  profit, of course since running the business, buying and maintaining
  bikes, paying insurance etc. is not free but it's still a feasible
  business[fn:8].

- Let's compute a few more measures: median (or middle magnitude) and
  standard deviation (a measure of spread) for ~count~, and
  minimum and maximum for ~registered~:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    # compute statistical measures
    median = hour['count'].median()
    std_dev = hour['count'].std()
    min_reg = hour['registered'].min()
    max_reg = hour['registered'].max()

    # print results
    print(f'Median count:{median:.2f}')
    print(f'Standard deviation of count:{std_dev:.2f}')
    print(f'Minimum number of registered users:{min_reg}')
    print(f'Maximum count:{max_reg}')
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Median count:142.00
  : Standard deviation of count:181.39
  : Minimum number of registered users:0
  : Maximum count:886

- The average is quite far away from the median, which suggests that
  the spread of the data is high, and that there may be outliers. In
  general, the median is a better measure for centrality in this case.

- The summary shows that there are hours when no registered users are
  present, and the difference between the maximum and the mean and
  median also shows that the data is quite spread out.

- The standard deviation shows the spread most clearly: the smaller
  this number, the closer together are the data.

- You can also get summary statistics more quickly with =pandas
  =describe= method, which lists summaries for all numeric columns:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(hour.describe())
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example

  [8 rows x 16 columns]
  #+end_example

- Here, ~count~ is the total number of records or rows of data used for
  the computations. ~25%~, and ~75%~ are the first and the third quartile,
  and ~50%~ is the median: for example, 25% of the hours in the dataset
  had 40 users or fewer, while 75% had more.

- Some of these make no sense for the variables: ~season~ for example is
  a /categorical/ variable, a finite set {1,2,3,4}. For such variables,
  none of the statistical summaries are meaningful.

- Summary stats can be used to quickly verify data validity: for
  example, if an experiment with people reports an average age of 200
  for the participants, something is wrong. Such errors are quite
  common in research.

- Besides checking the data, summary stats are important for business
  decisions: e.g. you could reduce prices during the night to reduce
  the number of hours with lower ridership, or you could reward
  operators in whose shift the maximum ridership is surpassed.

- Much of what follows goes more deeply into the data, and in
  parallel, into the business. To do this, we must isolate subsets of
  data and look which patterns we can find in them.

- Data science happens between these two poles: the dataset as a
  whole, which must be managed, imported, stored, etc., and subsets of
  the data, which correspond with parts of the world. Any story worth
  telling has large and small aspects, just like a human has a
  character, and also individual traits worth looking at.


* Analysing nighttime data

- To pursue the idea of changing pricing during the night, we need to
  check summary stats related to just the nighttime.

- As you might have guessed, there is not only a method for selecting
  columns but also a method for filtering rows from the data table,
  =loc=. For example, to filter the ~count~ data for row number ~3~:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    Print(hour.loc[3,'count'])
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 13

- We had better check with the dataset if this number is correct. Can
  you recall, how we printed the first 5 rows of the dataset ~hour~?
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(hour.head())
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :    instant      dteday  season  yr  ...  windspeed  casual  registered  count
  : 0        1  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       3          13     16
  : 1        2  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       8          32     40
  : 2        3  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       5          27     32
  : 3        4  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       3          10     13
  : 4        5  2011-01-01       1   0  ...        0.0       0           1      1
  :
  : [5 rows x 17 columns]

- You find the value 13 in the ~count~ column in the row indexed by 3
  (which is the fourth column because we start counting at 0 [fn:9]).

- A table always has rows and columns: the square brackets =[ ]= are an
  *index operator* with two arguments, ~[rows,columns]~. So ~[3,'count']~
  extracts the table elements with a row index of ~3~ and the column
  name ~count~.

- Since ~count~ also happens to be the column number ~16~, the following
  command would give the same result. Notice that it uses =iloc= and not
  =loc=:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(hour.iloc[3, 16])
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 13

- How can you know that ~count~ is column number 16 except by counting
  manually using for example the =columns= command?
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(hour.columns)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Index(['instant', 'dteday', 'season', 'yr', 'mnth', 'hr', 'holiday', 'weekday',
  :        'workingday', 'weathersit', 'temp', 'atemp', 'hum', 'windspeed',
  :        'casual', 'registered', 'count'],
  :       dtype='object')

- We need a test that goes through the column labels and checks which
  one is ~count~ - the =get_loc= method from the =pandas= Index object does
  the trick:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(hour.columns.get_loc('count'))
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 16

- Or you could write a little function yourself that goes through the
  =Index= object (converted to a =list=) returned by =columns,= and checks
  each label:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    Index = list(hour.columns)
    index = 0
    for i in Index:
        if i=='count': print(index)
        index = index + 1
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 16

- Wrap this in a function:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    # function definition
    def getloc(dataframe, label):
        '''Return positional index for dataframe label
        dataframe: a DataFrame
        label: string label for dataframe column
        '''
        Index = list(dataframe.columns)
        index = 0
        for i in Index:
            if i==label: return index
            index = index + 1

    # function call
    print(getloc(hour,'count'))
    print(getloc(hour,'registered'))
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 16
  : 15
  : 16
  : <class 'int'>

- We can also check a *range of values* by using the *colon* operator
  (=:=) - for example, to extract rows [indexed] 2 to 4 from the
  ~registered~ column, we would write:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(hour.loc[2:4,'registered'])
    print(hour.iloc[2:5,15])
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 2    27
  : 3    10
  : 4     1
  : Name: registered, dtype: int64
  : 2    27
  : 3    10
  : 4     1
  : Name: registered, dtype: int64

- Notice another difference between =loc= and =iloc=: the latter leaves
  out the the last index after the colon! For a complete comparison,
  see the =pandas= [[https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html][online documentation]].

- The process of filtering a subset of data is called /subsetting/.

- Within the =loc= method, you can use /logical conditions/, that is you
  can filter values based on a logical check with a logical operator.

- Example: in the following code chunk we filter all rows from the
  ~registered~ column whose ~hr~ value is smaller than 5, or 12pm to 4am,
  and then we average over them:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(f"{hour.loc[hour['hr'] < 5, 'registered'].mean():.2f}")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 20.79

- The answer: on average, 20 to 21 bikes were taken out in the small
  hours of the morning.

- With multiple conditions we can achieve more detail: what if we want
  to check, which nighttime rentals took place while the temperature
  was relatively cold or relatively warm? Logically, we're looking for
  two conditions to both hold, requiring the AND (=&=) operator.

- Instead of packing statements, it's good practice to store
  intermediate results before printing them:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    cold = hour.loc[ (hour['hr'] < 5) & (hour['temp'] < .50), 'count']
    warm = hour.loc[ (hour['hr'] < 5) & (hour['temp'] > .50), 'count']
    print(f"Average users at night when it was cold: {cold.mean():.2f}")
    print(f"Average users at night when it was warm: {warm.mean():.2f}")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Average users at night when it was cold: 19.52
  : Average users at night when it was wram: 33.64

- We can also check inclusive conditions, for example to find out how
  many bikes were taken out on average when the temperature was warm
  OR (=|=) the humidity was high:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(f"{hour.loc[(hour['temp']>0.5)|(hour['hum']>0.5),'count'].mean():.2f}")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 193.37


* Analysing seasonal data

- Another business improvement strategy could target a ~season~, which
  is recorded in the data as 1 for winter, 2 for spring, 3 for summer
  and 4 for fall.

- The =groupby= method for =pandas= groups all records according to a
  value or set of values:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(hour.groupby(['season'])['count'].mean())
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : season
  : 1    111.114569
  : 2    208.344069
  : 3    236.016237
  : 4    198.868856
  : Name: count, dtype: float64

- Let's dissect the command whose individual parts should be clear by
  now:
  1) ~hour.groupby~ calls the ~groupby~ method on the ~hour~ DataFrame
  2) ~hour.groupby(['season'])~ creates groups for the ~season~ values
  3) ~hour.groupby(['season']['count']~ selects the ~count~ column
  4) ~hour.groupby(['season']['count'].mean()~ averages over each group
     of the subset.

- The result shows the average ridership in winter (1), spring (2),
  summer (3), and fall (4), and a definite pattern: higher ridership
  in spring and summer, and lower ridership in winter and fall.

- We can also group multiple columns: first by ~season~ and then by
  ~holiday~: additional column labels are listed in the =groupby=
  argument:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    print(hour.groupby(['season','holiday'])['count'].mean())
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example
  season  holiday
  1       0          112.685875
          1           72.042683
  2       0          208.428472
          1          204.552083
  3       0          235.976818
          1          237.822917
  4       0          199.965998
          1          167.722222
  Name: count, dtype: float64
  #+end_example

- Here, the hourly data are first split by ~season~ and then the result
  for each ~season~ is split into holidays (1) and non-holidays (0). We
  notice that holidays don't make a positive difference in fall and
  winter.

- In a similar way, you can take other columns, analyze them by asking
  questions, and link the results to business decisions.


* Drawing and displaying a simple plot

- Displaying data in a tabular format with columns, headlines etc. is
  already a form of visualization. Another approach is making plots.

- It is fairly easy in most languages (except SQL and bash who are too
  specialized on their focus of databases and system commands, resp.)
  to create simple graphics, which is all what we're after here.

- For more specialized, highly customized, or animated graphics, there
  are separate packages available, which often require substantial
  time investment. At Lyon, there is an extra course on "data
  visualization" that teaches this stuff.

- Here are the minimal steps to make a plot
  1) Decide what you want to plot
  2) Import a Python library that knows how to plot to our current session
  3) Decide what type of plot to make
  4) Select the data for the plot
  5) Create the plot
  6) Display the plot

- Example: Let's say we want to see how the ~count~ values, the total
  number of rides, varied over time: this means that ~count~ is our
  dependent, and ~instant~ (which is a running label for the hours) is
  our independent variable. Every data point is a pair, and therefore
  a /scatterplot/ (points scattered across the canvas) is suitable to
  show this pattern [fn:10].

- Here's the code with comments:
  #+name: Ridership counts by hour as a lineplot
  #+begin_src python :file dids1.png :python python3 :session *Python* :results output graphics file
    # import graphics library
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    # clear graphics
    plt.clf()
    # define variables
    x = hour['instant'] # independent variable
    y = hour['count'] # dependent variable
    # create the plot
    plt.plot(x,y)
    # display the plot
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig("dids1.png") # or plt.show() outside of Org-mode
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: Ridership counts by hour as a lineplot
  [[file:dids1.png]]

- This plot looks more like a painting than a scattering of points:
  this is because there are so many data points - all the rides taken
  out (y-axis) plotted for every hour of two years (x-axis), and
  because the default plot is a lineplot. Using =scatter= instead of
  =plot= gives us an impression of scattered points.
  #+name: Ridership counts by hour as a scatterplot, with grid lines
  #+begin_src python :file dids2.png :python python3 :session *Python* :results output graphics file
    plt.clf()
    plt.scatter(x,y)
    plt.grid()
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig("dids2.png")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: Ridership counts by hour as a scatterplot, with grid lines
  [[file:dids2.png]]
  
- What information can you get from this plot?

  1) Seasonal variation: a year has about 8760 hours - the middle
     point of the graph shows a clear minimum. This type of graph with
     two distinct hills is also called /bimodal/.
  2) Overall trend: the corresponding seasons show that the second
     year of operation was a great deal more successful than the
     first, almost by 50%.
  3) Statistical summaries: You cannot read their values off readily
     but looking at the gridlinds, you can confirm several of the
     summary statistics by order of magnitude.


* Clarifying plots with titles and labels

- It wouldn't be easy to explain this plot to someone else. To clarify
  the presentation, we can add labels and a title to the plot.

- We only need to add a few extra methods. Notice that we're cleaning
  the canvas and redrawing the figure:
  #+name: Ridership counts by hour, with axis labels and a title
  #+begin_src python :file dids3.png :python python3 :session *Python* :results output graphics file
    plt.clf()
    plt.scatter(x,y)
    plt.xlabel("Hour")
    plt.ylabel("Count")
    plt.title("Ridership Count by Hour (2011-2012)")
    plt.savefig("dids3.png")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: Ridership counts by hour, with axis labels and a title
  [[file:dids3.png]]


* Plotting subsets of data

- The dataset is very large, and looking at all the data at once is
  hard. We use subsetting to plot a smaller subset, for example the
  first 48 hours of 2011 - the second argument to =loc= (~:~) includes /all/
  columns:
  #+name: Ridership counts by hour for the first 48 hours of 2011
  #+begin_src python :file dids4.png :python python3 :session *Python* :results output graphics file
    # subset dataset
    hour_first_48 = hour.loc[0:48,:]
    # data for plotting
    x = hour_first_48['instant']
    y = hour_first_48['count']
    # plotting
    plt.clf()
    plt.plot(x,y)
    plt.xlabel("Hour")
    plt.ylabel("Count")
    plt.title("Ridership Count by Hour (Jan 1-2, 2011)")
    plt.savefig("dids4.png")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: Ridership counts by hour for the first 48 hours of 2011
  [[file:dids4.png]]


* Testing different plot types

- To properly understand and train yourself in the use of functions
  like =plot=, you must read the [[https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html][online documentation]].

- There are many ways to alter the appearance of a plot. For example,
  you can a =marker= parameter, which has multiple values to change the
  data points, and the =color= parameter to change the color of the
  graph. ([[https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.markers.MarkerStyle.html#matplotlib.markers.MarkerStyle][Source]]).

- In the next plot, we draw the data points as filled circles and
  change the color to green:
  #+name: Ridership counts by hour for the first 48 hours of 2011 - altered color and markers
  #+begin_src python :file dids5.png :python python3 :session *Python* :results output graphics file
    plt.clf()
    plt.plot(x,y, color='green', marker='o')
    plt.xlabel("Hour")
    plt.ylabel("Count")
    plt.title("Ridership Count by Hour (Jan 1-2, 2011)")
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig("dids5.png")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: Ridership counts by hour for the first 48 hours of 2011 - altered color and markers
  [[file:dids5.png]]

- You can alter the line type as well. In the next plot, we show
  ~casual~ and ~registered~ riders over the first 2 days of the dataset,
  distinguished by color and linetype. We also introduce the =legend=
  method, which automatically adds a legend for every =label= and =linestyle=.
  #+name: Ridership counts per hour, first 2 days, for casual and registered users
  #+begin_src python :file dids6.png :python python3 :session *Python* :results output graphics file
    # subsetting
    y1 = hour_first_48['casual']
    y2 = hour_first_48['registered']
    # clear plotting canvas
    plt.clf()
    ## first plot: casual riders
    plt.plot(x,y1, color='red', label='casual',linestyle='-')
    ## second plot: registered riders
    plt.plot(x,y2, color='blue', label='casual',linestyle='--')
    ## labels and title
    plt.xlabel("Hour")
    plt.ylabel("Count")
    plt.title("Ridership Count by Hour (Jan 1-2, 2011)")
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid()
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig("dids6.png")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: Ridership counts per hour, first 2 days, for casual and registered users
  [[file:dids6.png]]

- The plot shows that the number of casual riders is almost always
  lower than the number of registered riders. This plot would benefit
  from a legend that explains what the graphs mean.

- So far we've only seen scatterplots and lineplots. Another
  interesting plot type is the /box plot/, also called "box and
  whiskers" plot.

- To draw the boxplot, we'll load another package, =seaborn=, which
  works alongside =matplotlib= ([[https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html][documentation]]):
  #+name: Boxplot of registered users by hour
  #+begin_src python :file dids7.png :python python3 :session *Python* :results output graphics file
    # import seaborn package
    import seaborn as sns
    # plotting
    plt.clf()
    sns.boxplot(x='hr',
                y='registered',
                data=hour)
    # labelling
    plt.xlabel("Hour")
    plt.ylabel("Count")
    plt.title("Ridership Counts by Hour")
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid()
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig("dids7.png")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: Boxplot of registered users by hour
  [[file:dids7.png]]

- Let's analyze the plot:
  1) the independent x variable is the hour column of our ~hour~ =DataFrame=
  2) for each hour, the statistical summary is computed and shown as a
     box with whiskers: the lower whisker is the minimum, the upper
     whisker is the maximum, the lower and upper edge of the box are
     the 25% and 75% percentile respectively, and the bar across the
     box is the median (or 50% percentile).
  3) The individual data points shown above several of the boxes are
     /outliers/, values that don't "fit in the box" and that are too far
     away from the average.
  4) The format of the =seaborn= =boxplot= is slightly different: you can
     pass the name of the =DataFrame= to the function using the =data=
     parameter.

- You can now compare ridership at different times of day. You can see
  the impact of rush hour or work commutes between 5-7 am and 5-6 pm.

- When you're interested in frequency or number of counts of a numeric
  variable, a /histogram/ is a useful plot. It uses the =bins= parameter
  to specify the number of bins where each bin contains a range of
  values ([[https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html][documentation]]).
  #+name: Ridership histogram - frequency of counts
  #+begin_src python :file dids8.png :python python3 :session *Python* :results output graphics file
    plt.clf()
    plt.hist(hour['count'], bins=80, edgecolor='black')
    plt.xlabel("Ridership")
    plt.ylabel("Frequency")
    plt.title("Ridership Histogram")
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig("dids8.png")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: Ridership histogram - frequency of counts
  [[file:dids8.png]]

- Since the number of bins is fixed, the total ridership is divided
  equally among the total number of bins. You can see that there are
  way more riders in the first bin in our data: for more than 2,000
  hours, ridership was very low. For 500 hours, ridership was
  around 100.

- A histogram could be used to think about the capacity of the
  company: if you have 1,000 bicycles available, you could probably
  sell 200 of them since very few hours have more than 800 bikes
  rented out.

- A /pair plot/ pairs more than one pair of variables: it draws every
  possible scatterplot for every possible pair of variables in your
  data. For this plot, you don't need to specify the labels:
  #+name: Pair plot for three variables
  #+begin_src python :file dids9.png :python python3 :session *Python* :results output graphics file
    # variables to pair up
    vars = ['hr', 'temp', 'windspeed']

    # subsetting
    hour_first_100 = hour.loc[0:100, vars]

    # plotting
    plt.clf()
    sns.pairplot(hour_first_100, corner=True)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig("dids9.png")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: Pair plot for three variables
  [[file:dids9.png]]

- The plot contains both scatterplots and histograms. There aren't
  clear patterns among the data points in the scatterplots -
  temperature, windspeed and hour don't seem to be strongly
  correlated, that is they don't exhibit a strong tendency to grow or
  fall together.

- The study of variables that are coupled is an important part of data
  science because it allows us to indirectly draw conclusions from one
  feature of the data to another feature (for example: holidays and
  ridership); in many cases, we can let go of variables that are so
  strongly correlated that they don't provide new information (that's
  good because carrying variables along eats up computing power); and
  it allows us to simplify visualizations and storytelling.

- Highly correlated variables are like groups of people where you only
  care about one person so having to deal with the group may be
  boring - even though you may at other times care about the group.


* Summary

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves using various tools to
  deeply understand the data's origin, size, content, meaning,
  quality, format, potential insights, and logical next steps.

- Establishing a business scenario provides context and meaning to the
  data, making it more relevant and engaging for analysis.

- Analyzing a dataset, such as bike-sharing data, helps identify
  patterns and insights that can inform business decisions and
  strategies.

- CSV files are simple, portable, and widely supported for storing raw
  data, although spreadsheet applications offer enhanced readability
  and computational flexibility.

- Importing and displaying data in Python involves reading CSV files
  into a format suitable for analysis, using libraries like pandas.

- Summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation,
  provide quick insights into data properties and potential business
  implications.

- Subsetting data allows focused analysis on specific conditions, such
  as nighttime ridership, to explore patterns and inform decisions.

- Grouping data by categories, like season and holiday, reveals trends
  and variations that can guide business strategies.

- Creating plots in Python, such as scatterplots and line plots,
  visualizes data trends and patterns, aiding in analysis and
  communication.

- Adding labels and titles to plots enhances clarity and helps convey
  the data's story effectively.

- Subsetting large datasets for specific time frames or conditions
  provides more manageable and focused visualizations.

- Experimenting with various plot types, like box plots, histograms,
  and pair plots, helps uncover different aspects of the data and
  enhances analysis.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] [[https://cran.r-project.org/web//packages//explore/vignettes/explore-mtcars.html][Here is one]] where ~mtcars~ was used to demonstrate the
capabilities of an R package called ~explore~ (part of a vignette for
this package). The original source for the dataset is given as
Henderson & Velleman (1981).

[fn:2] If that's an honorable or desirable goal is another question:
some people, especially in the US, might say that bikes aren't very
practical in the US, while in Europe for example, bicycles are very
common in cities (but the cities look very differently - for one
thing, they're a lot more packed and distances - e.g. to work or to
the shops - are generally shorter, and the weather is more temperate).

[fn:3] Of course, the scenario could also have the opposite effect:
for example, passionate peace activists may not wish to work with data
of arms manufacturers; people of one culture may not care about data
about people from another culture etc. Therefore, it helps if, in
addition to an interest in the data, you also enjoy getting to know,
and master, computational and mathematical tools of data science.

[fn:4] I obtained the data from [[https://bradfordtuckfield.com/hour.csv][Tuckfield (2023)]]. He notes that the
original source is [[https://ride.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data][Capital Bikeshare]] for Washington D.C., and that the
data was compiled and augmented (?) and posted by others at a
non-disclosed location.

[fn:5] Another popular choice would be R, which is also FOSS, even
easier to learn, and better equipped for statistics and
visualization. A third possibility is to stick with the CSV format and
use text mining tools on the command line, so-called /shell/ commands,
which are super-fast, small and simple.

[fn:6] I've left out the /install/ step because this is done outside of
Python using the =pip= package manager program. To install the =pandas=
package, run =pip install pandas= on your computer. Of course, you first
have to have (and possibly install) the =pip= program.

[fn:7] One way of achieving this is to read new code (and especially
code written by others) /from the bottom/ and /from the right/, i.e. the
wrong way around: in this way, your brain has to make sense of what
you read rather than delude itself into understanding what it
doesn't understand. One way of stopping yourself from learning how
to code is to always copy and paste blindly, or (worse) let
generative AI do it for you. This works only for the simplest of
programs. Once you are an expert, you may make good use of AI.

[fn:8] In case you were wondering if bike sharing is a business at
all, according to [[https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/bike-sharing-market][Mordor Intelligence]], the global 2024 bike sharing
market has a size of $7.85 billion, projected to increase to $12.44
billion over the next 5 years. Such a prediction is, however,
dependent on many volatile factors, e.g. the need for urban
transportation, the reduction in costs, and state subsidization.

[fn:9] This is normal for most programming languages, including C,
C++, Java and JavaScript, and it has historical reasons. The language
R starts counting at 1 instead, which I always found very helpful.

[fn:10]Following the change of a variable like ~count~ over time is also
called a /time series/ - that's an important data structure for
example in finance or climate research where important quantities
vary over time. Every interesting quantity varies over time,
of course, but if we explicitly show the change of one quantity
against time, that's a time series.
