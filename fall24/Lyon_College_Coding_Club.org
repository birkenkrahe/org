* Weekly activities

** Weekly Coding Challenge
- Activity: Solve a coding problem from a platform like LeetCode or
  HackerRank. Choose problems that can be reasonably solved within
  30-45 minutes, allowing time for discussion and explanation of
  solutions.
** Lightning Talks
- Activity: Each week, one or two students give a 5-10 minute
  presentation on a technology or programming concept they find
  interesting. This could include new frameworks, programming tips, or
  tech trends.
** Code Review Session
- Activity: Review and critique a piece of code from a project,
  homework, or open source project. Discuss ways to improve it,
  focusing on readability, efficiency, and functionality.
** Pair Programming
- Activity: Students pair up and work on a small problem or feature
  together. This helps them learn from each other and practice
  collaborative coding techniques.
** Algorithm Club
- Activity: Focus on a specific algorithm each week, discussing its
  mechanics, applications, and coding it in real time. This could
  range from sorting algorithms to more complex algorithms like
  Dijkstra’s or A*.
** Debugging Drills
- Activity: Practice debugging by working on small, buggy code
  snippets. This helps improve problem-solving skills and
  understanding of common programming errors.
** Tech Quiz
- Activity: Have a quiz on programming concepts, recent tech news, and
  logical puzzles. This can be a fun and competitive way to learn and
  solidify knowledge.
** Mini Hackathon
- Activity: Once a month, hold a mini-hackathon where students spend
  the hour brainstorming and starting a quick project or feature. This
  could also span multiple sessions if needed.
** API Integration Practice
- Activity: Spend the session integrating a simple API into a small
  application, such as pulling data from a public API (like weather or
  news) and displaying it.
** Mentorship Moments
- Activity: Invite senior students or faculty members for a quick
  mentorship session where they can provide advice on projects,
  courses, and career in tech.
