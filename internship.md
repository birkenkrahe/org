# Objectives

An internship can be an important "rite of passage", allowing you to
test your skills in a real work environment. It can help you to find
out who you are, what you want (or don't want) to do with your life
and your education, it tests your assertiveness and networking skills,
professional attitude,punctuality, stamina leadership issues, and much
more. This course was designed to support you during your internship
and help you make the most of the experience. Depending on the number
of participants, we will meet weekly for max one hour of discussion,
you will write a weekly short (150 words) blog on GitHub, and briefly
present your internship at the end of the course.


# Target audience

This course serves any student who wants to have a successful career
right out of the academic gates. Some topics may also be of topical
interest to you as a student of psychology, or other disciplines
