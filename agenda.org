   * Structured group discussion[fn:1]
   * Protocol: Fortunato

** Group discussion

| A: Can technologists learn anything from historical documents? If yes (or no), why (not)? |
| B: What's the feeling tone of the film? Optimism, scepticism, ambitions?                  |
| C: SWOT analysis (Strenghts/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats)                             |
| D: What are the key questions/issues here: are they still current?                        |

* Footnotes

[fn:1]"Structured group discussion" means that I'm providing a
framework for group discussion and group results (e.g. a set of
questions), and a timeline. Your job is to execute the framework
within the allotted time and present the results as good as you
can. For participation, only participating and trying (harder) is
evaluated, not the quality of the result itself.
