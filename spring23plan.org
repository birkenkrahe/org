* Introduction to Programming in C/C++ (CSC 100)

  This course introduces you to programming using C. We cover C++ as an
  extension. C is a system programming language of pure power: it
  enables you to converse with the computer at a level unknown to users
  other high level languages many of which come from C. You also learn
  about: compilers, working on the command line, text editors Emacs,
  using C for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, cybersecurity, using
  pseudocode and process modeling. You get a foundation in critical
  thinking in concert with one of the three currently most popular
  languages (the other two, according to the [[https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/][TIOBE index]], are Python and
  Java). The course is for anyone who is interested in learning
  computational thinking and basic programming skills. You get: short
  lectures and practice sessions with interactive notebooks, weekly
  quizzes and program assignments. You'll learn some great tools: we use
  the "hacker's editor" Emacs, the world's foremost software engineering
  platform, GitHub, and SAP Signavio for process modeling. This course
  also prepares you for "Data structures with C++" (CSC 240) and
  "Algorithms" (CSC 265). Prerequisites: none. Offered again in: summer
  2023, spring 2024.

* Digital humanities - working with text data (CSC 105)

  *WHY?* Have you ever wondered how DALL-E creates realistic images from
  text input, how bots like Alexa and Siri work, or how AI writes
  automatic essays?  The basis of these technologies, which are widely
  applied in the humanities, is Natural Language Processing (NLP), and
  its foundation is text mining with computers. *WHAT?* This course serves
  as an introduction to text mining using R. R is a statistical
  programming language used mostly by non-programmers to manipulate,
  analyse and visualize data. We cover: fundamentals of R, basic
  quantitative text data analysis, metadata and markup languages like
  XML, and many examples including: the novels of Jane Austen, sentiment
  analysis from Twitter messages, and NASA datasets. *WHO?* The course is
  for anyone who is interested in learning computational thinking and
  understanding digital technology through a data science lense. *HOW?*
  Short lectures and practice sessions with interactive notebooks,
  weekly ungraded quizzes and home assignments. You'll learn some great
  tools of lasting importance: the "hacker's editor" GNU Emacs, the
  world's top software development platform, GitHub, and command line
  "UNIX" tools for text manipulation. You work on your own project
  throughout the term using the agile project management methodology
  Scrum. Offered again in: spring 2025. *Prerequisites:*
  none. Introductory knowledge of R or of another programming language
  is useful but not obligatory[fn:1].

* Introduction to advanced data science (DSC 205)

  This course continues the journey into data science using the
  functional, object-oriented statistical programming language R. We
  will also explore data science using command line UNIX tools. In
  contrast to the basic introduction (DSC 105), we will explore some
  "Tidyverse" packages like ~dplyr~ (for data frame manipulation) and
  ~ggplot2~ (for plotting), as well as the RStudio IDE and R Markdown for
  data science publishing. The course is accompanied by DataCamp
  assignments from the [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-r]["Intermediate R"]] course and includes a
  certificate. This course prepares you well for 300-level data science
  courses like data visualization (302) and machine learning (305) or
  special topics courses like "Extending R" (482). You'll also learn
  some great tools of lasting importance: the "hacker's editor" GNU
  Emacs, the world's top software development platform, GitHub. You work
  on your own project throughout the term using the agile project
  management methodology Scrum. Offered again in:
  spring 2024. *Prerequisites:* introductory knowledge of R as taught in
  DSC 105 or obtained independently by completing the DataCamp online
  course "Introduction to R" or "fasteR: Fast Lane to Learning R!"
  (chapters 1-15 only, freely available on GitHub), or Davies, The Book
  of R (NoStarch, 2016, Part I only). Basic R concepts are repeated and
  practiced at the start of the term.

* Machine learning (DSC 305)
  *Why?* Machine learning (ML), a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
  is everywhere! It supports any job that requires repetition or looking
  at data, and gathering conclusions to make decisions. The course
  covers different methods to make predictions with ML: linear and
  logistic regression, decision trees, and deep learning (neural
  network) models. You'll learn to work with open-source libraries like
  ~Keras~ and ~TensorFlow~ by Google. Application examples include:
  predicting house prices, image recognition, and transformers, the
  technology behind language processing AI. Some assignments will come
  from DataCamp, an online learning platform for data scientists (with
  certificate). You'll also learn some great tools of lasting
  importance: the "hacker's editor" GNU Emacs, the world's top software
  development platform, GitHub. You work on your own project throughout
  the term using the agile project management methodology Scrum. Offered
  again in: spring 2025. *Prerequisites:* none. ML requires imagination,
  creativity, and a visual mind - if you enjoy finding patterns and
  spotting correlations, then you can do ML. Some proficiency in R or
  Python or another programming language is useful. If you completed the
  advanced introduction to data science (DSC 205) and/or data
  visualization (DSC 302), this course is definitely for you. If you're
  just curious but not sure if you can manage, talk to me and/or learn
  the basics of R on your own[fn:1]!

* Internship supervision (CSC 301/401)

  *Why?* An internship can be an important "rite of passage", allowing
  you to test your skills in a real work environment. It can help you
  to find out who you are, what you want (or don't want) to do with
  your life and your education, it tests your assertiveness and
  networking skills, professional attitude,punctuality, stamina
  leadership issues, and much more. This course was designed to
  support you during your internship and help you make the most of the
  experience. *What?* We will meet weekly for one hour of discussion,
  you will write a weekly short (150 words) blog on GitHub, and
  briefly present your internship. *Prerequisites: none.* Offered again
  in: fall 2023. *Who?* This course serves any student who wants to have
  a successful career right out of the academic gates. Some topics may
  also be of topical interest to you as a student of psychology, or
  other disciplines related to success in the workplace.
