* Objectives

Data science is concerned with getting data to work for us, to give us
its (presumed) hidden treasures. Data science has been called "the
sexiest job of the 21st century". Even if you don't want to become a
professonial data scientist, it's helpful to master the basic concepts
if you want to succeed in today's data-driven business.

This course focuses on data science basics, simple visualization and
productivity tools using the statistical programming language R as our
starting point.

* Target audience

The course is for anyone who is interested in becoming more data
literate in their own field of interest - be it languages, theatre,
biology, psychology or exercise science - and growing their personal
skill stack.

Visualization of data-driven insights and improved productivity when
working with data and media is a concern for any professional.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete "Introduction to data science" (DSC 105) will be
able to:

- Learn computer and data science principles by playing with data
- Acquire basic statistical programming skills using R
- Apply literate programming principles to their work with interactive
  notebooks
- Use infrastructure including command line, Jupyter notebooks, GitHub
- Understand the relationship of humans, machines, and data
- Develop their critical thinking skills
- Learn how to effectively use AI coding assistants like Copilot, Code
  Interpreter (ChatGPT)
- Understand the impact of, and can code in R, Python, SQL, bash
- Know how to effectively present assignment and project results

Students, who complete DSC 105 will have fulfilled the prerequisites
for DSC 205, Introduction to advanced data science, which focuses on
advanced practices in data exploration, visualization, and integration
with databases and other languages through R and Python packages and
APIs.

* Course requirements

Formal prerequisites: Introduction to Programming (either CSC100 or
CSC115 or CSC109, and MTH101 (College Algebra).

Otherwise no prior knowledge required. Some knowledge of, and
experience with computers is useful but not critical. Curiosity is
essential. You will gain data literacy skills by taking this
course. The course will prepare you for further studies in computer
and data science, or in other disciplines that use modern computing,
i.e. every discipline, from accounting to zoology).

* Grading

| WHEN    | DESCRIPTION                 | IMPACT |
|---------+-----------------------------+--------|
| Weekly  | DataCamp assignments        |    25% |
| Monthly | Sprint review presentations |    25% |
| Weekly  | Tests                       |    25% |
| TBD     | Final exam                  |    25% |

Notes:
- To pass: 60%
- DataCamp assignments: there are 15 assignments spread out over 3
  courses. Each assignment contributes 1.6667% (25/15) to your final
  grade. Late assignments are counted as 60% complete only.
- Sprint review presentations: a customer-focused team effort
  resulting in a project presentation, with 4 Scrum sprint reviews.
- Tests: weekly online quizzes, which are previewed and reviewed in
  class.
- Final exam: selection of the most challenging weekly quiz questions.
