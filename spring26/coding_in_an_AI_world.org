* Course Description

This course teaches beginners how to use modern AI systems as *agents*
capable of planning, acting, automating, and collaborating. Students
learn to transform their own real-world workflows into agentic
automations through structured conversation, without requiring prior
programming experience.

The course ends with a practical capstone project that automates a
genuine workflow drawn from a student’s work or academic environment.

* Time, Date & Location

- Time: Tuesday + Thursday: 2:30 PM-3:45 PM	
- Dates: 1/14/2026 - 5/8/2026
- Location: Lyon Campus (TBC)

* Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:
1. Describe a workflow clearly using natural language.
2. Collaborate with an AI agent to break workflows into steps.
3. Use conversational prompting to create simple automations or scripts.
4. Build repeatable agentic workflows with verification and guardrails.
5. Recognize limitations and failure modes of agentic tools.
6. Deliver a functional workflow automation in a capstone project.

* Prerequisites
  None.

* Required Materials

- A laptop (any OS).
- Access to modern AI tools (ChatGPT or similar).

* Meeting Structure (75 minutes)

- *Mini-lecture* (15–20 minutes): concept, demonstration, context
- *Hands-on workshop* (45–50 minutes): guided agentic workflow building
- *Reflection + verification* (5–10 minutes): checking reliability,
  summarizing lessons

* Weekly Schedule
