** I'm teaching the following courses in fall 2022:

   Contact me if you want details on any of these - the descriptions
   are also on GitHub. I'm looking forward to seeing you in class!
   
   * Summer '22 - *Introduction to programming in C*. This course
     introduces you to programming using C. We cover C++ as an
     extension. C is a system programming language of pure power: it
     enables you to converse with the computer at a level unknown to
     users other high level languages many of which come from C. You
     also learn about: compilers, working on the command line, text
     editors Emacs, using C for Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
     cybersecurity, using pseudocode and process modeling. You get a
     foundation in critical thinking in concert with one of the three
     currently most popular languages (the other two are Python and
     Java). The course is for anyone who is interested in learning
     computational thinking and basic programming skills. You get:
     short lectures and practice sessions with interactive notebooks,
     weekly quizzes and program assignments. You'll learn some great
     tools: we use the "hacker's editor" Emacs, the world's foremost
     software engineering platform, GitHub, and SAP Signavio for
     process modeling. This course also prepares you for "Data
     structures with C++" (CSC 240) and "Algorithms" (CSC
     265). Prerequisites: none.
     
   * Fall'22 - *Snap! Programming Playground*. Create exciting games,
     animation and media computation, and learn computer and data
     science principles by playing with data. *What this is about.* In
     this course, you will complete a series of game and animation
     projects using the visual, drag-and-drop programming language
     Snap!  You will learn basic computer and data science principles,
     and understand how computers help us control the world around
     us. You will graduate from mere consumer and user to powerful
     programmer while playing around with blocks on the
     screen. Acquiring programming skills will help you develop your
     critical thinking. *What we will do.* We will meet weekly for
     practical problem solving and interactive exercises. In between
     classes, you will work on small assignments like this [[https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?user=birkenkrahe&project=TimeMachine][Time
     Machine]], and you will read short textbook chapters or watch short
     instructional videos. You'll get to present your own work and
     (optionally) publish your finished projects for the whole world
     to see, and if things go well, perhaps we'll go to Snap!Con in
     California next year! *Why you should do it.* This course is for
     you if you're curious about visual programming, if you don't know
     if working with computers is for you, or if you're interested in
     media, the arts, data, or in developing games. Snap! is also a
     great stepping stone to move on to higher languages like Python,
     R, C or C++. If you already have some knowledge of computing,
     programming or media computation, you'll be right at home and can
     add visual languages to your skillset. The course also serves as
     an easy entry into computer or data science degree programs.

   * Fall'22 - *Introduction to data science (DSC 105):* Data science is
     about how to get data to work for us, to give us its hidden
     treasures. Data science has been called "the sexiest job of the
     21st century". Even if you don't want to become a professional
     data scientist, it’s helpful to master the basic concepts if you
     want to succeed in today's highly data-driven business
     environment. This courses focuses on: data science basics,
     visualization and productivity tools. The course is for everyone
     who is interested in becoming more data literate and growing
     their skill stack. You get short lectures and practice sessions
     with interactive notebooks, weekly quizzes and
     assignments. You'll get a free subscription to the DataCamp
     learning platform. You'll learn some great tools: we use the
     "hacker's editor" Emacs, the world's foremost software
     engineering platform, GitHub, and the statistical programming
     language R, which is perfect for easy visualization of complex
     data stories. You show your skills as part of a capstone group
     project. Prerequisites: none. This course will be offered again
     in fall 2023.

   * Fall'22 - *Data visualization (DSC 302):* There are many tools and
     platforms out there to visualize patterns found in data and tell
     engaging, convincing stories. As a data scientist, you have to
     know what's out there, understand the principles of good visual
     presentation, and be able to customize plots quickly. In this
     course, we look at popular platforms like Tableau, PowerBi and
     even Excel, at languages like Snap! and Processing, and the R
     Shiny package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps
     straight from R.  The course is for everyone who is interested in
     becoming more data literate and growing their skill stack. You
     will get lectures, practice sessions with interactive notebooks
     and weekly quizzes. You'll get a free subscription to the
     DataCamp learning platform for assignments. We'll use Emacs, R,
     and other languages as needed. You will create and present your
     own visualizations as part of a capstone project. Prerequisites:
     introduction to programming (CSC 100 or CSC 115), or consent of
     the instructor. This course will be offered again in fall 2024.

   * Fall'22 - *Applied math for data science (CSC 482):* Data science
     is known to be math and stats heavy, but most of the math power
     is under the hood - you don't see much of it. This course will
     help you bridge the gap between what you already know and what is
     required to do exploratory data analysis. In this class, real
     datasets are used extensively, and all work is supported by R
     coding. We cover applications like PCA, mixture distributions,
     random graph models, Hidden Markov models, linear and logistic
     regression, Monte Carlo simulations, and neural networks. The
     course leads the student to think critically about the how and
     why of probability and statistics, and to see the big
     picture. The course is not theorem/proof oriented.  picture."
     You will get lectures, practice sessions with interactive
     notebooks (in Emacs) and weekly quizzes. You will work on a term
     project alone or in a group that you will present. Prerequisites
     are calculus, some matrix algebra, and some experience in
     programming (it doesn't need to be R). This course is
     cross-referenced as a math special topics course (MTH 445). This
     course will be offered again in fall 2024.

   * Fall'22 - *Internship course:* An internship can be an important
     "rite of passage", allowing you to test your skills in a real
     work environment. It can help you to find out who you are, what
     you want (or don't want) to do with your life and your education,
     it tests your assertiveness and networking skills, professional
     attitude,punctuality, stamina leadership issues, and much
     more. This course was designed to support you during your
     internship and help you make the most of the experience. We will
     meet weekly for one hour of discussion, you will write a weekly
     short (150 words) blog on GitHub, and briefly present your
     internship. Prerequisites: none. This course is offered every
     term.

** DONE COR 100 syllabus draft
   DEADLINE: <2022-04-04 Mon>

   TITLE: Snap! Programming Playground - create exciting games,
   animation and media computation, and learn computer and data
   science principles by playing with data.

   Snap! is a free, drag-and-drop visual programming language derived
   from MIT's Scratch for kids that's also a platform for serious
   computer and data science. It was developed at the U of Berkeley.

   *What this is about.* In this course, you will complete a series of
   game and animation projects using the visual, drag-and-drop
   programming language Snap!  You will learn basic computer and data
   science principles, and understand how computers help us control
   the world around us. You will graduate from mere consumer and user
   to powerful programmer while playing around with blocks on the
   screen. Acquiring programming skills will help you develop your
   critical thinking.

   seeing you in fall!

   *Lecturer:* [[https://www.lyon.edu/marcus-birkenkrahe][Marcus Birkenkrahe]] is an Associate Professor of Data
   Science at Lyon College since 2021. A particle physicist by
   training, he was one of the original developers of the World Wide
   Web. He's been programming since he was a boy, he's an avid gamer
   (on PS5), and he likes free software.

   #+begin_quote
   Your descriptions don’t need to be extremely detailed at this
   point, so a sentence or so will do for each of the following:

   (a)    A general description of your course

   (b)   Examples of possible activities, readings, and assignments

   (c)    Who might be interested in your course


   As an example, here’s the info for my COR 100 course:

   (a) In this course, we will explore the psychology of fear and
   horror. Much of the course will involve viewing, discussing, and
   analyzing horror movies, but we will also explore other mediums for
   horror, including short fiction, video games, and perhaps even more
   hand-on experiences.

   (b) Coursework will involve reading articles, stories, and excerpts
   from longer works (e.g., Stephen King's Danse Macabre), as well as
   watching movies. The course also involves practicing note-taking,
   writing papers, and other assignments.

   (c) Anyone is welcome to take this class, but it will be a great
   fit for those who like horror, enjoy analyzing movies, and/or are
   interested in psychology. You should also be aware that many of the
   assignments will expose you to content that some may find
   disturbing or offensive. If you are sensitive to specific types of
   content, please feel free to contact me for more information. I am
   happy to help you determine whether this class is a good fit for
   you!


   Finally, next fall Dr. Peter Staples is piloting a new approach for
   Year 1, focused on projects aimed at solving complex social
   problems (e.g., housing, poverty) and looking to recruit first
   years into majors and projects where they can work on these
   problems during their time at Lyon. Let me know if this is
   something you’re interested in discussing further or trying, and we
   can set up a meeting among interested faculty later this semester
   to discuss the details.

    Reply to [[https://youtu.be/lkIicfzPBys][Stevey's Tech Talk E39 -- A guided tour of Emacs]] (YouTube,
    Mar 7, 2022)

    #+begin_quote
    Excellent intro to Emacs. To answer your question: I'd love more
    content like this. Will pass this on to my students whom I introduced
    to it this term for the first time, with some success. I introduced it
    in courses with R, SQL, C, C++ and bash as a literate programming
    tool. The students had 2 weeks with lots of practice in class and the
    Emacs tutorial by their side, and they all got there, irrespective of
    their background. The biggest issue: all of this had to happen on
    Windows boxes, because that's what the lab has. It's a myth that Emacs
    is too difficult or that it takes months to wield it as a programming
    tools. I remember it well because I learnt it as a physics student
    decades ago. The students still use the mouse sometimes, because they
    don't just live in Emacs (as I do) but they understand the power of
    Emacs. All my exercises and lectures are presented as Org-mode
    notebooks for them to work through during and after class - and they
    do! I went there after hearing Daniel German at Emacs 2021 speak about
    "Using Org-mode to teach programming".

    Great - will share with my students! I'm teaching the command line in
    all courses this term, too (besides Emacs). A grand experiment for me,
    and overall very successful. More so in the Operating Systems class
    (working on Linux boxes) than in others, but the shell appears
    everywhere replacing the GUI whenever possible. Students see me do
    this inside Emacs in every session and it slowly re-colors their
    world, I think.

    Kurt -

    I met with Melissa last week to prepare for the telephone

    and Law.

    She said she would talk to you about turning my visiting position
    into tenure-track and accelerating the process given my seniority
    (14 years of teaching experience), the positive teaching
    evaluation at Lyon, and my need for leverage when negotiating my
    continued leave of absence from Berlin (where I have tenure
    already).

    Please let me know if there's anything I need to do in the short
    or medium term to get this process started.

      One of the things I found helpful to do was to write a short

      anything I'd done differently, done well, done poorly, or that
      seemed effective (or not). That way, I didn't have to try to

   Hi Paul -

   I've uploaded the questionnaire for Carlye. I'm quite unsure how
   this will work for 2021 because of our change of residence:

   I did not understand the column "Cost basis" for capital gains: we
   sold our residence in Berlin (bought 2003) and bought a new house
   in Batesville in October 2021.

   Also, I am not sure if capital gains apply to Carlye (taxpayer) at
   all since the house was in my name.

   Since I have a greencard now (permanent resident as of 10 Dec
   2021), I also wonder if you know if I must file my taxes for 2021
   already given that I live in the US since August 2021 (working on
   an H1B visa, with a social security number).

   Thanks for your help - please let me know what other information
   you need and if you have any idea about these questions of mine.

   Cheers,
   Marcus
   ph. (501) 422-4725

   PS. Are you taking care of our taxes both for Germany January
   2021-July 2021, and US from August 2021-December 2021, or only
   Germany? And what are you suggesting about our time in the US -
   surely we both have to pay taxes for Aug-Dec, too? Thanks.

** DONE Revised manuscript IJDS
   DEADLINE: <2022-03-14 Mon>

   #+begin_quote
   "1. The usability evaluation process (UEP) just put together
   several existing methods. Overall, it looks quite general. The
   manuscript lacks a clear explanation regarding what specific
   designs for process mining tools (PMTs) were included in the
   process."
   #+end_quote
   The specific designs of these process mining tools are not
   generally available because they are commercial.

   #+begin_quote
   "1a. If the authors intended to create a UEP specific for PMT, they
   should highlight its unique features designed for PMTs"
   #+end_quote
   The usability evaluation process (UEP) was specifically
   designed for process mining tools (PMT) - none of the tests for
   the user group are transferable to other tools.

   #+begin_quote
   "1b. If they are developing a general UEP, more case studies are
   needed to demonstrate its generalizability."
   #+end_quote
   (AK check???) It was not our purpose to create a general UEP
   (see a). The study is meant to address the lack of transparency
   in the fast growing PMT market.

   #+begin_quote
   "2. The study ranks the usability of the PMTs evaluated. These are
   all commercial software. Do the authors have conflict of interest
   with the software? In fact, reporting a ranking of commercial
   software seems controversial in a scholarly journal."
   #+end_quote
   The authors have no conflict with the software. One of them is
   an academic researcher, the other one completed the study as a
   Master student and has only recently moved into a commercial
   position in a small IT consulting firm not linked to PMTs.

   #+begin_quote
   "3. The literature review in Table 1 includes four references only. The
   subsequent ‘attribute’ summary/discussion based on it can be biased
   due to the small number of reviews. The authors should conduct a
   comprehensive review of literature to summarize prevalent
   ‘attributes’ to assess."
   #+end_quote
   For space reasons, only four key references are listed. We have
   more than 100 [???] references on usability. The publisher asked to
   limit the amount of material cited.

   #+begin_quote
   "4. The authors chose four attributes from Table 1 to include in
   the evaluation process. Why were other attributes not included?
   There lacks solid reasoning."
   #+end_quote
   The selection of attributes followed Sagar & Saha (2017), a
   systematic review of software usability studies, covering 150
   studies over a perior of 26 years. It seemed unnecessary to
   repeat those authors' arguments in our paper.

   #+begin_quote
   "5. The authors applied the UEP to six PMTs. Why were these six
   PMTs selected? Popularity? The authors need to explain."
   #+end_quote
   (AK ADD ???) The six selected tools were the most popular tools in the
   market, and they were the only ones where access was granted
   without a license.

   #+begin_quote
   "6. There are too many figures and many of them are not
   necessary. For example, Figures 2-7 about PMTs’ interfaces can
   be moved to an appendix. In addition, Figures 12-16 can be
   simplified as a table."
   #+end_quote
   (AK ???) Taking these figures out would, in our view, make the paper less
   readable, but we gladly follow the reviewer's suggestion.

   #+begin_quote
   "7. Are Figures 1 and 8 exactly the same as those in the
   references? Recreate them instead of copying them directly."
   #+end_quote
   Both figures had already been recreated and not copied - this is
   mentioned in the caption ("based on" + citations).

   #+begin_quote
   "8. Use colorblind-friendly pattern/palette for Figures 8
   and 9. For example, in Figure 8, the authors can use different
   shapes of markers (e.g., round and square) in combination of
   different line types (e.g., solid and dash) to differentiate the
   six PMTs."
   #+end_quote
   We are not aware that colorblind-friendliness was a requirement of
   the publisher. AK ???

   #+begin_quote
   "a. Consider the sentence “Here, process mining tools provide
   assistance by e.g., automated process discovery models.” Why is
   there an ‘e.g.’?"
   #+end_quote
   There is an "e.g." because automated process discovery models are
   only an example for the support provided by PMTs. Others are, e.g.
   process conformance checking, and process variant analysis.

   #+begin_quote
   "b. “The technology consists of different techniques which identify
   correlations within process data …” The ‘process data’ reads
   confusing. Is it input, intermediate (under process), or output
   data?"
   #+end_quote
   Changed to "input data" (???)

   #+begin_quote
   "c. “Overall, related studies … focus on functionalities of process
   mining tools.” What are these studies related to? Furthermore,

   something else? The authors may change it to “Most studies related
   to evaluating process mining tools focus on the functionalities of
   the tools …”

*** Answer

    Kurt -

    Thank you for your email re: data science - I was totally unaware of
    these developments though it's not surprising.

    Perhaps it would be a good idea for me to meet and brainstorm with the
    marketing department.  I filled out a survey and sent it to them in
    August, now might be a good time for them to review it and see if it
    holds any marketing potential. I have a long CV and there are things
    in it that might be useful for raising our profile. For example, I
    looked at all the other data science programs and none has a
    professor with my data science experience in industry, research, and
    knowledge management, and most of them have a tiny research profile
    and no current training, and are merely repackaging existing CS and
    math offerings. I believe that my extensive industry and research
    experience helped me get this job, so it seems a shame not to use
    them for recruitment now that I'm here.

    I have given it some thought and I have various ideas - such as
    video introductions on the website, and an article in the alumni
    magazine - but I would really need to liaise with the marketing
    department to know what else the university can realistically
    implement. For example I think it would be something unique - and
    useful - to integrate data science into the pre-health
    concentrations.  This may even help attract faculty to those
    areas.

   Hi Madeline -Thanks for your email. 

   #+begin_quote
   I hope you're doing well. I am working on updating our data science
   major page so we can promote it to prospective students, but I need
   some info I'm hoping you can help me with.
   #+end_quote

   I'm doing great, thank you! Congratulations on your own career
   move! Happy to provide info though it would be good if you could
   help me understand what exactly you are looking for.

   #+begin_quote
   Do we have any recent data science alumni, and if so, where are they
   working currently?
   #+end_quote

   We don't have alumni of the program as such because it has only
   been in existence for 1 year or so, and I this is my 2nd
   term. We've got a bunch of talented students though and I have
   pretty high expectations.

   A few students have lately been successful in securing job interviews
   for data science positions (e.g. at J B Hunt), and data science
   internships (at Stone Ward).

   Recent (?) alumni that I know of: Zach Ward '21 works as a Data
   Engineer for a large games production company in CA. I only just
   heard of Mandy Bradford '?? who works as a Data Engineer at Acxiom
   AR. David Sonnier may know more.

   #+begin_quote
   In your opinion, what makes the data science major at Lyon College
   unique?
   #+end_quote

   I can give you a few bullet points right off the bat. Though I
   think the current text [[https://catalog.lyon.edu/data-science/the-data-science-major-bs][on this page]] is very good and has exactly
   the right general focus.

   * World-class teaching and research excellence: None of the other
     data science programs in AR have a professor with my data science
     experience in industry, research, and knowledge management ([[https://www.lyon.edu/marcus-birkenkrahe][see
     profile]]).

   * Job market and career focus: We train students directly for a
     fast-growing data science job market. To do this, we link
     internships, instruction and inspiration through real life data
     science problems. Helping students train for a rewarding career
     is my focus from day one of any class.

   * Curricular integration/Data science major and minor: Lyon offers
     a wide spectrum of data science courses and applications - you
     don't need to be a math or computer science person to excel and
     learn here: an interest in biology, biostatistics, business,
     entrepreneurship, exercise science, or data-driven humanities
     (like psychology) is just well suited to pursuing opportunities
     to learn and work in data science.

   * True blue: the data science major and the different concentration
     are not repackaged existing offerings in computer science and
     maths. Instead, they are custom-made, industry-first, original
     offerings.

   * Liberal arts tradition: Lyon's established, 150-year tradition in
     the liberal arts guarantees that data science is grounded in
     societal values appealing to modern students. At Lyon, data
     science is not locked up in the scientific ivory tower but
     benefits from and aims to serve the needs of the community.

   * Sports applications: Lyon's active eSports and athletics programs
     provides ample opportunity for data analytics. We've gote quite a
     few eSports athletes in our data science classes: perhaps you
     could interview some of them and ask them why others should also
     come to Lyon and study data science?

   I am sure you can say all of this better, and better suited for a
   marketing purpose! None of the other (new) data science programs
   that I have seen online in the state has really good stories to
   tell - I think we do.

   As an aside, I think we could perhaps do quite a bit more to raise
   the profile than improve the text on the web page - such as a video
   introduction on the data science page (saw this at another AR
   school and likedit), or an article in the alumni magazine (I filled
   in a survey back in 2021 but never heard back).

   Comments from current students might also be interesting to
   prospective students.

   Our partnership with Stone Ward is quite active - we've had Matthew
   Stewart give a talk to students, and the first mini internship this
   summer is tentatively filled - maybe an opportunity to feature the
   student in the news.

   Happy to talk some more about this, if it helps.

   Cheers,
   Marcus

   PS. we also have an active academic alliance with several training
   companies and important data science providers, including:
   DataCamp, SAP Signavio (Process intelligence), and Celonis (Process
   mining)

   PPS. another concrete action point that I cannot do anything about
   but marketing could: someone could update my Wikipedia page to
   reflect the fact that I am now at Lyon College (and not in Berlin),
   add the faculty page etc. Students are probably looking at
   Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Birkenkrahe

   I cannot do this because it's an encyclopedia not a personal
   website. But Lyon college could. You need a Wikipedia registration
   to do this.

   #+begin_quote
   Do you have any data science students you'd recommend that we could
   reach out for a student profile?
   #+end_quote

   a few students come to mind who have already reaped some
   successes - either via internships or via job interviews, or
   because they're pursuing interesting projects at the moment:

   * AISHA MAHMOUD (jun)
   * JACOB SAMPLEY (sen)
   * WYATT FRERICHS (jun)
   * BEN GRAFTON (sen)

   I have not spoken to them but I think they'll all be pleased to be
   asked - if only because of the networking effect for their own
   careers! However, they are shy as techies tend to be.

   I'm also unable to say if they have declared anything - David
   Sonnier would know this better than I. He should also OK any
   changes to the marketing materials since they're his brainchild
   much more than mine!

   A couple more seniors that come to mind as potential interview
   partners and that have done a lot of data science classes with me in
   these last 2 terms

   * DAT O
   * NICK CHANEY

   Another student who is a little older, self-paying who might be
   pleased to be asked and also would have a lot to say:

   * VICTOR NOPPE

   All of these are very good students.

   There is something else I forgot to say, but Pat Lynch thought it
   would be relevant: we've bought a bunch of Rasperry Pi computers
   that I use in class to teach students command line data science
   skills and for projects. That might be attractive to prospective
   students because I think it's probably rare. You need to let me
   know if you want this wrapped in a paragraph.

   TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

   Ms. Aisha Mahmoud has been my student in the data science program of
   Lyon College in Fall 2021 and in Spring 2022. She attended several of
   my courses:
   1. Introduction to Data Science (DS101), which included learning R and
      data visualization with both Base R and ggplot2; in this class, she
      completed a data exploration project.
   2. Introduction to Advanced Data Science (DS205), which included
      intermediate R skills, exploratory data analysis, basic
      Tidyverse knowledge, interfacing R with SQL, C++, data science
      on the command line (with bash), and literate programming with
      Emacs;
   3. Database Theory and Applications (CSC330), which included
      learning SQL for data query, definition and manipulation, and
      intermediate SQL with subqueries and common table expressions.

   In all of these courses, Aisha has consistently been at, or near,
   the top of the class in terms of participation, programming, and
   grades. In the more advanced courses, she competes successfully
   with seniors.

   I know Aisha as a highly disciplined, committed, curious
   student. She is socially skilled, multi-lingual and already shows
   leadership potential above her years. She commands respect across
   the Lyon campus among her peers and other faculty members. I have
   no doubt that, given the opportunity, she will have a stellar
   career and distinguish herself.

   I highly recommend Aisha for the Stone Ward summer internship
   without reservations. I think she can add tremendous value in the
   right environment, and I am looking forward to see what experiences
   and project results she will bring back home to Lyon College.
   Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions. Thank
   you for giving Lyon's students this opportunity!

   Best regards,

   Good evening -

   A while back, I said that I would send you a flyer, or a list of
   talking points for students or prospective students who might be
   interested to study data science at Lyon, either as a major or as a
   minor. Prompted by a question from Marketing, I have now created the
   list, and you can find it attached. Hopefully, this will help with
   your advising/recruiting efforts. Cheers, Marcus

*** Website (new) text to marketing
**** DS suggestion

     #+begin_quote
     Lyon College is the first private institution in Arkansas to
     offer Data Science.  This academic program provides valuable
     insights into the understanding and implications of large sets of
     data.  Students initially gain the theoretical background and
     problem-solving experiences through introductory Computer Science
     and Data Science programs, then focus on one of three broad
     general areas:

     - science,
     - business and economics,
     - social sciences and humanities

     For the science track, students will take three science classes
     at the 200 level or above, and for each class, the students will
     take a data science lab with a course-related project.

     For the business and economics track, students will meet the
     requirements for a minor in business or economics or complete
     certain classes in business, economics and accounting.

     For the social sciences/humanities/fine arts track, students will
     complete the Digital Humanities course as well as two classes
     from either the social sciences, humanities or fine arts
     divisions. For each class, the student will take a data science
     lab with a course-related project.

     In addition to hands-on experience, Lyon students will also have
     the opportunity to earn academic credit by participating in
     internships.

*** Message to Kristi Price, Sept 27

    Internship class: I'm going to tell you about this as well though
    if you're interested it might take a little longer. I'll give you
    the short story right here: At my former university, I established
    an internship course: I met with the students as a supervisor on a
    weekly basis. Each student had to give one presentation on their
    internship, and write brief weekly blog posts on a series of
    issues loosely aligned with the internship workflow - here is a
    copy from the current course, which has only ONE student...

    * [August 29] Your hiring process
    * [September 5] Your first impressions
    * [September 12] Your internship goals
    * [September 19] Your internship system
    * [September 26] Your work culture
    * [October 10] Your assertiveness
    * [October 17] Your networking
    * [October 24] Your work values
    * [October 31] Your work hierarchy
    * [November 7] Your skills
    * [November 14] Your accomplishments
    * [November 21] Your career aspirations

    An internship is a major place of learning where supervising faculty
    can do much good - both for the students and for the community. I'm
    going to pour this into a proper internship syllabus that I will send
    you ahead of the meeting. I'm interested in acquiring many more
    internship students from different disciplines, because there's no
    real dependency on computer or data science, and internships are
    continuous recruiting events. It seems important not to waste such an
    opportunity given that Lyon wants to increase its student
    count. Perhaps this is something to also share with admissions, or
    whoever is responsible for this at Lyon? I'd be happy to talk to a
    larger group about my experiences. I've also published about it, see
    here (with a focus on virtualizing the supervision, which is possible,
    though real life meetings are better, of course).

** Why do so many compsci students drop out

   [[https://qr.ae/pGQzIa][Link]] - quora.

   I wonder how many of these issues are relevant at Lyon. Quite a lot
   of it seems accurate. I'm trying to keep the final exam at 30% and
   the questions are known in advance. Still, 60% rely on
   exams. "Progress at breakneck speed" is not how I experience
   Lyon. "Cumulative knowledge" is only relevant when topics actually
   build on top of one another, which in CompSci is rare. At the same
   time, techniques and tools are very similar across different
   applications - which means that you can do a lot with
   little. Boredom - I cannot understand this. I don't find geeks
   boring - but then, I'm a geek myself.  It's also not clear why many
   females would make a class more interesting.

** WAITING Piper magazine

   Q: How would you describe your research interests to someone who is
   not an expert in your field?

   A: Data science crosses different disciplines in order to help
   businesses, organizations and individuals to succeed in today's highly
   data-driven world. I'm especially interested in cybersecurity
   applications of machine learning, and in robotic process automation.

   Q: Please list any recent accolades or achievements related to your
   scholarly activities.

   Q: I have published widely (nearly 60 publications) in many different
   areas: neural nets, particle physics, e-learning, literate
   programming, process modeling, entrepreneurship, and data science. I
   am associate editor of the International Journal of Data Science, and
   an editorial board member of the International Journal of Big Data
   Management. Over the past decade, I have obtained federal grants
   totalling 3 mio. US$. In the early 1990s, as a PhD student, I was
   involved in the original development of the World-Wide Web.

   Q: How are you involved in our local community? Please list any
   current volunteer service.

   A: I've only just moved here with my family from Germany one months
   ago - it's a little too early for community involvement. However, I've
   got some experience with mentoring and coaching startups, and I'd love
   to get involved in an incubator. I'm looking forward to meeting
   members of the local community, and see where I could contribute. An
   example: Lyon College has a strong computer science and a new data
   science program - as interns, our students could bring cutting-edge
   technology knowledge to businesses and organizations.

   Q: Whom among your faculty colleagues has a cool project or a
   compelling story that you believe merits attention in the alumni
   magazine? Why?

   A: Moving from one of Europe's capital cities (Berlin) to teach
   Artificial Intelligence in rural Arkansas sounds like a story worth
   telling, even though it is still unfolding.

   Q: Is there another Lyon story you believe would be of interest to
   alumni? Please feel free to suggest one here, and include contact
   information if available.

   A: When you're new and from far away, everyone has an interesting
   story to tell. I love the fact that Lyon has a college radio (KILT),
   and that faculty and staff are contributing - last Sunday I listened
   to Prof. Oriatti's 2 hours of classical music at "lamplight". I'm
   really impressed by the pipe band, and I'm resolved to learning to
   play playing myself.

   Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

   ich kann das Geraet leider nicht zurueckschicken, weil ich nicht
   laenger in der Wohnung lebe, und wir auch nicht mehr in Deutschland
   gemeldet sind. Ich habe jetzt meinen Wohnsitz in USA.

   Bitte stellen Sie mir die Kosten des Routers in Rechnung - ich zahle
   sie gerne - und beenden Sie meinen Vertrag aus besonderen
   Gruenden. Ein Abmeldeformular habe ich nicht, weil mir die Behoerde
   keines geschickt hat (bzw. es hier noch nicht angekommen
   ist). Beifuegen kann ich das Uebergabeprotokoll des Maklers - mehr
   Unterlagen habe ich leider nicht.

   Dass der Vertrag weiterlaeuft, geht natuerlich nicht. Ich werde
   entsprechende Schritte bei der Bank einleiten und die automatische
   Abbuchung beenden.

   Beste Gruesse aus Arkansas,
   Prof. Dr. Marcus Birkenkrahe
