* What is this?

  A place for irregular articles of possible interest to students
  across all courses, mostly to avoid lengthy emails and to park
  content that I may want to develop later on time permitting.

* Sunday, 11 July 2021 - GitHub & Cybersecurity
** GitHub
   Opted for GitHub as the course platform since I may be arriving too
   late to get up to scratch with Lyon's "Schoology" platform. Pro:
   opportunity to include Git and GitHub in the course. Con: separate
   platform. Another plus - just discovered that Emacs Org-mode renders
   as Markdown automatically[fn:1].

   Figured out how to link the GitHub remote repository (~master~) and
   the local repo (~origin~) and update the remote repo from the command
   line. In the end, however, I resorted to drag-and-drop addition of the
   org-file in question ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/blob/main/1_overview/1_overview.org][1_overview.org]][fn:2]), because I could not update the
   file inside the ~1_overview~ directory remotely. The best (fastest)
   solution would be to set up remote services using Emacs' [[https://magit.vc/][magit]].

   Instead of a forum, students can raise ~Issues~ in GitHub for
   discussion. This is just as good as a forum - except that the
   infrastructure is not protected and private. But this also helps to
   teach the students netiquette and data literacy when being online in a
   professional capacity.

** Cybersecurity

   Came back from Hamburg yesterday (family good-bye). Interesting
   conversation with a taxi driver on the way from the train station: he
   does not own a phone and entrusts anything personal only to
   handwritten notes. If he wants to share something personal with his
   friends or family at a distance, he writes a letter by hand and mails
   it via "snail mail" as it used to be called (does it still?). He's
   been "radicalized" in a way by media reports and books like this one
   by Harvard's Carissa Veliz, "[[https://www.harvard.com/book/privacy_is_power/][Privacy is Power: Why and How You Should
   Take Back Control of Your Data]]"[fn:3]. This made me think, once again,
   that it might be neat to focus on cybersecurity and create a course
   offering a couple of terms down the line. I recently read this 2020
   book on "[[https://www.packtpub.com/product/cyber-warfare-truth-tactics-and-strategies/9781839216992][Cyber Warfare-Truth, Tactics, and Strategies]]", which is far
   out, in some areas. Also interesting: AI and Cybersecurity, which is
   an active area of industry (see e.g. [[https://www.ibm.com/security/artificial-intelligence][at IBM]]), and which I will discuss
   in the AI seminar, also in this term.

   Next stop: syllabus!

* Sunday, 22 August 2021 - End of first week

  I'm pretty satisfied with the first week of classes - managed to get
  quite a bit of interesting content into each orientation session -
  enough for tests at the start at the 2nd week, and for six follow-up
  files. Three syllabi written though the schedules will be changing a
  lot - I've only been able to cover 30% of my material in the
  available time (story of my life, really). 

  Students are still a little reluctant to participate - I wouldn't be
  any different myself with a brand new instructor. The masks are not
  helping, of course. Harder to build rapport for me - I don't know if
  my interventions are working, if my jokes are funny, and if my
  lectures leave an impression. The eyes as the "windows of the soul"
  are definitely overrated in the classroom. 

  Perhaps this is for the best, because this way I may stop myself
  from talking too much, and the masks insulate the students from one
  another. Not quite as much as sitting at home during an online
  session, but enough to reduce intra-group distractions.

  Things I love: the support and the positive feeling all around -
  everybody wants to make this term work, everybody delivers or does
  their best - under such circumstances, it is easy to give one's
  best, too. My office. The heat! Batesville!

  I have two new lectures to finish ("What is AI?" and "What is a
  model?"), so I must be off, but I'll be seeing you soon. Tonight:
  takeaway - first Chinese buffet.

* Saturday, 28 August 2021 - Games and the Arkansas Experience

** Student projects
  I survived the 2nd week, too. Despite my reservations about the
  masks and all that, rapport is building and classes are getting more
  active. Found out that students are not used to writing long essays,
  and adjusted my expectations accordingly. That wasn't too hard since
  I don't like to read long essays! Next week is all about setting up
  the different projects - for an Exploratory Data Analysis project in
  DSC 101, for an essay on data modeling for DSC 482.02, and for an AI
  application project for DSC 482.01. I'm really looking forward to
  seeing what the students come up with. In many ways, data science is
  coming to a head - cp. the data vs. modeling debate kicked off by
  Andrew Ng, which cuts across the subjects of all three courses.

** Games industry in Arkansas?

   I had a nice conversation with an internship student, who turned
   out to like similar video games like I - the Dark Souls series, and
   other titles. From what she told me, there may be quite a pool of
   students at Lyon interested in video games. I'm inspired to think
   about ways in which one could use this talent for a gaming industry
   startup. This could be fun, and it could potentially be great for
   Lyon and for Batesville. There already is a thriving esports
   program at the college, and this might fit right in. Also: I need
   to get my hands on a PS5!

** Community

   On a losely related note: I got my Arkansas drivers license today!
   Beginning to feel like a full member of this community. Also: very
   impressed with the administrative processes all around. Getting
   your license in Germany is a major headache. Weeks later, they send
   it to you via surface mail. In Batesville, you present your
   documents, do a visual test, and minutes later you walk out, a
   freshly printed license and full ID in hand. It's a little like
   moving from a Kafka novel into a story where suddenly everything
   makes a little more sense.

** How to make the most of your internship

   For those interested in an internship, or already working
   somewhere - I believe that you might benefit from my internship
   course (and you can also pick up 1-2 credits). It involves weekly
   meetings of an hour in my office (currently on Fridays at 12 PM). a
   brief, informal presentation of your workplace and internship, and
   short, weekly blog posts on topics relevant to your internship. The
   course prepares you for the transition from college to work. Talk
   to me if you want to know more, or come to a Friday meeting. Don't
   just go to work and let this opportunity to learn go to waste!

* Sunday, 29 August 2021 - KILT Lyon College Radio

  Listened to "[[https://lyonradio.weebly.com/programming-schedule.html][Lamplight]]", an evening with classical music, by Prof
  Oriatti, and had a great time while preparing classes and,
  intermittently, exchanging emails with the radio host. I really love
  that Lyon has its own radio station. Must come up with some format
  (podcast?) on data science. If anyone has an idea, let me know. I've
  always wanted to be on the radio. Though a classical music show is
  very hard to beat. Oriatti presented a marvelous selection and was
  totally responsive to the listeners. He even mentioned data science!

* Learning is like (physical) exercise (Sept 8)

   Read this today in an article in WIRED magazine, "How to Ace
   Physics Class (Even if You Don't Ace Physics)" ([[wired][Allain, 2021]]):

   #+begin_quote
   "Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that learning can be
   fun, but it can also be hard and confusing. Think of it like exercise:
   The more you sweat, the more you gain. You won't get faster and
   stronger by watching videos of people working out; you actually have
   to do something. And remember, it’s OK to be confused. Confusion is
   just the sweat of learning."
   #+end_quote

   Having studied physics and earned a PhD somehow, this makes sense
   to me. The "watching videos won't help" resonates with me, too:
   there were none, when I was a student, and it reminds me of Sheldon
   Cooper in that Big Bang Theory show where he gets a bloody nose
   because he thinks he can ride a bike after watching YouTube videos
   about it[fn:4].

   Anyway, I wouldn't overstate the importance of confusion - some
   confusion comes from badly written textbooks, badly taught classes,
   confused instructors etc. - generally, the more mathematical a
   topic and a presentation, the less space there should be for
   confusion. There is also "creative confusion", which one
   experiences e.g. when stumped by a problem. This is really
   important to feel! If you never feel it, you're either a genius or
   you're not trying hard enough (you'd know if you're a genius).

* Relevance of agile methodologies

  Students in all of my classes work with agile methodologies. This
  week, the first sprint reviews are due. Here is some motivation to
  learn this stuff and to do it well:

  #+begin_quote
  "Bloomberg uses the Agile methodology, which has become common in the
  tech industry for application development. The main advantage of the
  Agile methodology is that it creates an interactive communication
  line between the business and engineering teams to iteratively
  deliver value." (Source: [[datacamp][DataCamp, 8/30/2021]])

* Short holiday diary

** Gratitude

  I'm very grateful for fall break: it's given me my first opportunity
  for a vacation in over 2 years. Here's me looking quizzically into
  the future (taken in Pensacola, FL, over the weekend[fn:5]):

  [[./img/beachpic.jpg]]

** Grading
  Back home, I'm procrastinating: need to finish grading tests for two
  courses, and setting midterm grades for three. I'm like a freshman:
  these are my first midterms. In Germany, where I taught before Lyon,
  students don't get any information on how they're doing during the
  term. Reality often comes crashing down hard on them only at the
  very end when it's too late. While I welcome this helpful attitude,
  it also makes students a little less independent: if you're not told
  how you're doing you have to ask the teacher (which is
  uncomfortable), and question yourself honestly. Both of these
  actions can help build skills that are useful later. Though many
  companies have elaborate feedback structures, official feedback
  often comes too late and is watered down as all standardized
  procedures are. Here is a quick look at the horror of such a
  standard, a "[[https://www.dm.usda.gov/employ/employeerelations/docs/Guide-ExPerfPlans.pdf][performance appraisal plan]]," if you don't know what I
  am talking about. As a manager, I spent a lot of time with similar
  tools, and I remain unconvinced of their actual value to the
  employee and to the company. 

** Ghost of Tsushima

   I've come back to this game on the new PS5, and it's fantastic: the
   mechanics of this game are so incredibly precise. I used to be a
   fencer in my youth, and the swordplay in "Ghost of Tsushima" is so
   close to the truth that I find myself remembering moves and parries
   from decades ago. Also, playing on "lethal" level (since this is my
   2nd playthrough) is almost as challenging as a "Souls" game (like
   Demon Souls, Dark Souls or Bloodborne): every single boss encounter
   needs to be studied, and it takes me 10 or more attempts to get
   anywhere (often more than that). It's wonderfully frustrating but
   of course also eats up time, which is why long game play is limited
   to the holidays. Image:

** Game of life   

   Not just 

  In closing, 
  
* Footnotes

[fn:5]This is a 10-hour drive from Batesville, AR. In Germany, 10
hours get you from Flensburg in the North (on the Danish border) to
Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the Alps (on the border to Austria). That's
as far as you can go in Germany, and in the Southlands, it gets you to
the nearest beach. The route goes through 5 different states, which is
great fun for a recent immigrant. Linda the friendly, boring Google
maps bot, announces each state, "Welcome in Alabama" etc.). You'd
think that I'd be knackered after driving for 20 hours but actually, I
am not, quite the opposite, I'm rather energized by the experience!

[fn:4]That (early) trust in the Internet is both endearing and
endangering. Endangering, because our brains don't have a switch or a
safety valve that reacts to fake Internet content, we are its
victims. Endearing, because so many people (I wanted to know how many
but I couldn't find reliable statistics - data science project!?)
upload helpful information for complete strangers.

[fn:3]An excerpt from this book might become an assignment for this
course and/or for the AI seminar.

[fn:2]Org-mode insight: to switch off automatic replacement of
sub/superscripts, add the line ~#+OPTIONS: ^:nil~ at startup.

[fn:1]Though the wiki pages cannot be added, they have to be exported
into Markdown, which is a bit of work. Note to self: automate workflow!
