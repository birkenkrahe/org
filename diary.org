* What is this?

  A place for irregular articles of possible interest to students
  across all courses, mostly to avoid lengthy emails and to park
  content that I may want to develop later on time permitting.

* Literate programming for C, R, SQLite

* "I can teach it to you but I cannot learn it for you"

  This quote always impressed me as a profound, perhaps trivial
  truth[fn:16]. I think it whenever I feel bad about a student
  failing on my watch, which does happen, though not all that often,
  I think. Last week, a bunch of students kind of failed a few of my
  tests. "Kind of" means that most of them did not actually fail (<
  50%) but the average success was still below my expectations -
  below 65% in three out of four courses.

  Today this quote flickered across my screen:

  #+caption: Feynman quote
  #+attr_html: :width 500px
  [[./img/feynman.png]]

  This relates, because, unfortunately for many of the students, it
  all begins with "memorization" of many initially unconnected
  facts. Computer science is much more like a craft, much more like
  medicine than mathematics. In practice, it is more focused on
  diagnostics and problem solving through heuristics than on
  creativity, thinking, understanding and questioning.

  In order to be a successful computer diagnostician, i.e. assess
  problems quickly and identify a catalog of possible solutions, you
  simply need to have a lot of facts at your hands. Unlike
  mathematics, and more like in biology perhaps, and medicine, these
  facts are not neatly organized so that learning a few principles or
  formulas enables you to save yourself from the woes of
  memorization. In fact there are many patterns but a beginner can't
  see them.

  One of my jobs as a teacher is to help students see the
  patterns. I do this by showing them how I use them - and I do this
  again and again and again. Different students develop the ability
  to see and act upon identified patterns at different speed and to
  different degrees. I have no doubt that some of them get much
  better at it than I could ever be.

  Put differently, to divide the lofty goals - thinking, understanding
  and questioning - from "memorization" is unfair and
  unrealistic. Some degree of memorization goes a long way towards
  developing these other abilities.

  The trick is not to avoid memorization - e.g. by dreaming that
  anything can be found online given good finding skills (a hope that
  is more often disappointed than justified, though Google will not
  hasten to let you know it). The trick is to make memorization fun.

  Now, unlike in medicine and biology, fun memorizing in computer
  science is always possible simply by playing around with programs
  and computers. For example, being able to use the command line for
  data science - to navigate, alter, and analyze files - depends on
  the knowledge (aka memory) of dozens of Unix commands. I have never
  tried to memorize a single of these commands, but I have spent
  countless hours trying to solve problems and playing around with
  them. In the process of doing that, I learnt using them. If I no
  longer need them, I don't use them, and I forget them quickly
  enough.

  Alas, I don't see many students do that, and I don't understand
  why. You can even have fun with flags!

* Charting your career

  Did a free online "career" test with truity.com. These 94 questions
  aren't really enough to establish independence - 400 or so are more
  like it. Still, I suppose problem solving to improve the world is my
  thing, leaning towards innovation.

  #+caption: Information processing and problem-solving process (Source: truity.com)
  #+attr_html: :width 600px
  [[./img/truity.png]]

  My "career interests" are more in line with how I see myself: I like
  making and building things, not necessarily creatively. As a
  teacher, I am a persuasion professional. Personally, I don't feel
  like much of a "thinker" and more like a "doer" but the test
  disagrees.

  #+caption: Career interests (Source: truity.com)
  #+attr_html: :width 600px
  [[./img/truity1.png]]

  If you're interested in career building, don't trust in these tests,
  but read Richard Bolles' "[[https://www.amazon.com/What-Color-Your-Parachute-2021/dp/198485786X][What color is your parachute]]" instead![fn:1]

* Connecting to GDrive on the Pi

  Spent a few hours figuring this out. I was mislead by a 2019 blog
  post, which suggested to create an app with Google Cloud Services
  (GCS) to do this, and then using the ~rclone~ program to access the
  app. This involved setting up an account with GCS, leaving billing
  information, setting up the API, etc.

  After I had done all that, I started ~rclone~ on the Pi and realized
  that it was all a lot easier than I had thought: ~rclone.org/drive~
  contains the complete instructions, independent of GCS.

  Even better: on GNU Emacs, Tramp + rclone enable seamless access to
  remote servers: in the picture, you see GDrive in the top buffer,
  below it you can see that autocompletion works as well. Tramp
  requires the format ~/rclone:gdrive:/~, where ~rclone~ is the
  method, like ~ssh~ or ~ftp~ etc.

  #+caption: GDrive in GNU Emacs
  #+attr_html: :width 700px
  [[./img/rclone.png]]

  Easy access to my Lyon GDrive was the last reason to keep my Windoze
  box. I am now full time on a tiny Raspberry Pi running Raspbian
  Linux. I will take it to class, too, and use it as my desktop
  (especially since the front desktop PC is the last old PC left in
  the room, and even slower than my 4GB Pi 4). Since all the Pi knows
  is on its 32 GB SD card, I am more portable than I've ever been.

  The only benefit from looking at GCS: I found out that you can get
  access to a free shell - in the picture, you see information about
  the OS and the CPUs. Apparently, this is a docker image.

  #+caption: Google Cloud Services shell

* Rasperry Pi projectL 5-inch touchscreen

  What I did over the weekend after recording a bunch of [[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgb17bzeNygo8GU6SivwwjsQj9QabqAJ][tutorial
  videos for Emacs]]. This touchscreen can also be attached directly to
  the Pi. I think I might find another way of mounting it or attach it
  to another Pi.

** Internship opportunities at Stone Ward, Little Rock

   (Via Matthew Stewart, Stone Ward Marketing Agency)

   #+begin_quote

Stone Ward is hosting our annual *paid summer internship* in our
Little Rock office this year. I was hoping you all could either point
me in the right direction to post this on a Lyon page or share the
information below for me. Our internships include Brand Management,
Public Relations, Copywriting, Graphic Design, Video Production, Email
Marketing, Web Development, and Media Buying.

If any data [science] students are interested in participating in
the summer internship, I would suggest they look at the media or
web development internships as those are the most numbers heavy.

Thanks so much!
   #+end_quote

*** Details:

    * APPLICATION DEADLINE: Friday, March 4, 2022
    * INTERNSHIP DATES: June 6 – July 29, 2022
    * LOCATION: Stone Ward office in Little Rock, AR
    * $2,800 stipend for living expenses

    This isn’t the kind of program where interns spend all day making
    coffee. Our interns get the chance to make a difference. Camp
    Reality is an exciting and immersive opportunity for students who
    are eager to learn about the world of advertising. We offer them:

    * Exposure to and experience in nine different departments, with
      a day-to-day focus on one
    * The opportunity to work on real-life assignments for clients
    * Building portfolio pieces
    * Time and space to collaborate on projects with fellow interns
    * Field trips that provide perspective on the different aspects
      of advertising
    * Lessons and advice from our experts within the agency

    Camp Reality is the internship for go-getters who are ready to
    put their boots on the ground. Do you know a student who fits the
    bill?

    If you do know them, please send them our way! Forward them the
    flyer and student letter that are attached to this email. For the
    students you don’t know personally, print and post flyers across
    campus. Our internships aren’t limited to any certain majors, so
    you can share this information with your colleagues in various
    departments – shoot them the [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g5xp4hgksKg0U0Yefq3CQ2uk8dcU6FOB?usp=sharing][attached student materials]] as well
    as the attached instructor letter.


** Virtual Micro-internships at Stone Ward

   Also related to Stone Ward marketing agency: I'm in the process of
   revitalizing the existing (since 2020) data science partnership
   with this firm. Matthew Stewart and a colleague will come and talk
   to us in the data science class (& I will share the talk/recording
   with all students in my classes) some time in March.

   Over the summer, there will be room for a couple of students to
   work on a data visualization project with Matthew and me (possibly
   involving R Shiny - an analysis dashboard framework based on R).

   Other micro internships - each lasting about 3 weeks of focused,
   intense work - might involve real clients of Stone Ward. While
   these micro-internships are unpaid, they are a great opportunity to
   learn skills, build a network, and start a project portfolio.

* The Battle Of The Five Armies (Jan 4, 2022)

  Some of the story behind the picture below that I also put in all
  courses on the Schoology platform.

  What I read this morning in "The Linux Command Line" (Shotts, 2019)
  summarizes my sentiments towards open source, and why I prefer it:

  #+begin_quote
  "Many people speak of 'freedom' with regard to Linux, but I don't
  think most people know what this freedom really means. Freedom is the
  power to decide what your computer does, and the only way to have this
  freedom is to know what your computer is doing. Freedom is a computer
  that is without secrets, one where everything can be known if you care
  enough to find out."
  #+end_quote

  This quote inspired me to read on and make the book from which is
  came central to my new course on "Operating Systems", which deals
  mostly with [[https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html][GNU/Linux]]. I've also (re-)joined the [[https://www.fsf.org/][Free Software
  Foundation]] at the end of last year, and I'm mandating Emacs in one
  (C/C++), and recommending it in all my other courses ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#why-emacs-for-programming][see also FAQ]]).

  #+attr_html: :width 600px
  [[./img/fivearmies.jpg]]

  I had already been quite bent on having fun with many languages:
  five will take center stage in my spring 2022 courses - *C/C++* in an
  introductory programming class, *SQL* in a class on databases, *R* in an
  advanced introduction to data science, and *Bash* (perhaps even
  *Awk*) in Operating Systems. Apart from R, all of these languages
  are important to instruct computers as part of large systems, which
  is why I created a whole lecture on "Systems" that, however, I don't
  think I'll have time to present. Will see.

  In any case, I am committed to have some programming fun and not let
  the party be spoilt by either COVID, or by the fact that 4 classes
  in parallel is a bit much. It'll be fine as long as I can remain
  faithful to my style, which is to source all courses from a common
  fount. Helpful: the ongoing support from both [[https://datacamp.com][DataCamp]] (through
  their tutorials), and [[https://signavio.com][Signavio]] (through their process platform).

* Creating simple process diagrams in Emacs (Dec 27, 2021)

  I needed diagrams because I wanted to make a simple
  diagram. Usually, I would have drawn this in Signavio, or in
  PowerPoint, made a screenshot, saved it and embedded it in the
  Org-file using Emacs. 4 steps, 4 softwares, and not much to show for
  it.

  Since I like to do everything in Emacs using the keyboard, I was
  curious if this can be done using ASCII, without extra tools. I
  found two ways (in fact, there is a third one, Emacs ~artist~ mode
  (built into Emacs) and ~ditaa~ (which is no longer distributed with
  Org).

  1) [[https://robrohan.com/2015/01/17/poor-mans-uml-artist-mode.html][Poor man's UML / Emacs Artist Mode]] (Rohan, 2015)
  2) [[https://flylib.com/books/en/2.27.1.72/1/][Drawing with ~picture-mode~]]
  3) [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-dot-diagrams.html][Generating simple process diagrams using dot and tables]]
  4) [[https://plantuml.com/emacs][PlantUML and Emacs]] - wrapper to [[http://www.graphviz.org/][GraphViz]]

  For today, I'll only try artist mode, but I'm especially
  interested in ~PlantUML~, because I want to teach the students to
  create simple UML diagrams before coding.

  *Note that these diagrams do not render properly on GitHub (either
  as Org or Markdown files), or as HTML in a browser. Best look at it
  in Emacs. For this post, I have inserted screenshots.

** ~ascii-art-to-unicode~

   When I looked for ~artist-mode~ in the ~*Packages*~ list, I found
   that it was built-in, but I found another neat addition in the
   package list, [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/ascii-art-to-unicode.html][~ascii-art-to-unicode~]]. This package polishes simple
   line drawings and makes them look much better. Installed
   it. Here is an example:

   | Key sequence        | Action or function           |
   |---------------------+------------------------------|
   | M-x artist-mode RET | Invoke artist mode           |
   | C-c C-a r           | ~artist-select-op-rectangle~ |


   [[./img/aa2u.png]]

   | Key sequence    | Action or function |
   |-----------------+--------------------|
   | C-c C-c         | ~artist-mode-off~  |
   | C-x n n         | ~narrow-to-region~ |
   | untabify region | ~untabify~         |
   | M-x aa2u RET    | Apply aa2u         |

   [[./img/aa2u1.png]]

   Check the [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/ascii-art-to-unicode.html][vignette for aa2u]] for more details.

** Emacs ~artist-mode~

   #+begin_quote
   "Most people that see me using it either think it’s the most
   ridiculous thing they’ve seen, or they think it’s the coolest thing
   since sliced bread." (Rob Rohan, 2015)
   #+end_quote

   I side with those who think it's cool. Tried this first a couple of
   years back when I returned to Emacs but haven't used it since.

   There is a [[https://youtu.be/cIuX87Xo8Fc][video demo]] (13 min) at the end Rohan's blog post. Here,
   I'm going to retrace the demo and aim at creating my own simple
   diagram at the end. I won't bother with PNG files via ~ditaa~ for
   now.

   To make the ASCII art into image files, Rohan suggests [[http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/][~ditaa~]],
   which apparently was bundled with Org in the past, but is no longer
   bundled with it.

   ~artist~ mode is built in. From the vignette[fn:2]:

   #+begin_quote
   "Artist is an Emacs lisp package that allows you to draw lines,
   rectangles, squares, poly-lines, ellipses and circles by using your
   mouse and/or keyboard. The shapes are made up with the ascii
   characters |, -, / and \."  ([[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ArtistMode][Source: EmacsWiki]])
   #+end_quote

*** Drawing a poly-line

    This is the example from the vignette:

    #+begin_example
    M-x artist-mode RET
    C-c C-a p RET
    RET
    #+end_example

    [[./img/polyline.png]]

    To create it, I just moved around the screen with my cursor, and
    Emacs created a line drawing from it. You should try it!

*** Rectangles

    #+begin_example
    M-x artist-mode
    C-c C-a r
    <draw rectangles>
#+end_example

    Here are a few examples[fn:3]:

    [[./img/rectangles.png]]

*** Add text

    #+begin_example
      M-x artist-mode
      C-c C-a t
      <enter text>
    #+end_example

    [[./img/text.png]]

*** Flood fill

    The following sequence created the filled rectangle below. You can
    call upon all ~artist-mode~ commands with the mouse
    ~<middle-button>~:

    [[./img/middle.png]]

    #+begin_example
    M-x artist-mode
    C-c C-a r
    <draw rectangle>
    <middle-button>
    <flood fill>
    #+end_example

    [[./img/fill.png]]

*** Other commands

    The image shows the ~artist-mode~ menu.

    [[./img/menu.png]]

    Especially when you have a tablet, drawing with "pen" is
    cool. Artist mode is for friends of the mouse or pen. Keyboard
    afficionados may prefer ~picture-mode~.

    Important: when drawing in an Org-mode file, use ~C-x n n~
    (~narrow-to-region~), to draw without disturbance. The presence of
    headlines gets ~artist-mode~ confused at times. Return to the
    buffer with ~C-x n w~ (~widen~).

    Cool: you can copy/cut/paste figures to the clipboard by drawing a
    rectangle around it.

    [[./img/clip.png]]

*** Rendering ASCII art as graphics

    [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-ditaa.html][~ditaa~]] will convert ASCII diagrams into bitmap graphics. ~ditaa~
    is a Java library that is executed on the command line after being
    loaded into Emacs as a Babel file. The second part of [[https://youtu.be/cIuX87Xo8Fc][Rohan's
    video demo]] shows examples.

    Can't wait to try this with students in class!
* My feeling before the spring term 2022 (Dec 26, 2021)

  [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMvBQlHSvB-gmQ4hvuvfkFg4YUxOee6m/view?usp=sharing][My feeling before the spring term 2022.]] (30 sec video)

  Also: I'm enjoying [[https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-year-in-math-and-computer-science-20211223/][2021's breakthroughs in maths and computer
  science]] (Quantamagazine, 2021) while preparing classes.

* Emacs + ESS + Org-Mode (Dec 23, 2021)

  There's a new kid in town - at least as far as Lyon CS is concerned:
  Emacs + ESS + Org-mode. There are various FAQs (that nobody ever
  asked, actually) on Emacs, and the whole topic will heat up now that
  I haved decided to introduce Emacs + ESS + Org-mode for literate
  source code programming (LitProg) and data science (DS) in all my
  classes.

  There is a deeper reason for Emacs and LitProg: CS people (everybody
  really) has to deal with information systems that get more and more
  complicated and conceptually difficult. Abstraction is the name of
  the game everywhere. CS and DS are system sciences (or crafts), and
  they deserve the best paradigm when it comes to system control and
  management, and Emacs is the answer to that.

  Here is a particularly interesting [[https://www.admiralbumblebee.com/programming/2020/01/04/Six-months-VS-Code.html][recent post]] by AdmiralBumbleBee
  (2020) contrasting VS Code and Emacs, concluding that Emacs is a
  superior environment when it comes to:

  * Windows management (with ~ace-windows~)
  * File management (with ~Dired~)
  * Coding (especially literate coding with ~Org-mode~)
  * Extending functionality (~Elisp~ packages)

  Especially for students (rather than developers with their
  state-of-the-art computers), Emacs is good because it's easy on the
  memory and the processing even if your laptop is not from 2022.

  I also enjoyed [[https://hadi.timachi.com/2019/12/07/Why_I_switched_from_VScode_to_Emacs][Timachi's post (2019)]], who switched to VS Code and
  back. Regarding Emacs' famous "steep learning curve" (which I cannot
  confirm - I remember learning Emacs for the first time ages ago, and
  re-learning it a couple of years ago):

  #+begin_quote
  "Emacs can be a challenge if you are used to using mouse
  pointer. One should be willing to leave the mouse and stick with the
  keyboard."
  #+end_quote

  He gushes over Org-mode, too - a main reason for our using Emacs
  this term:

  #+begin_quote
  "Org mode is for sure one of the most amazing pieces of software I
  have ever seen or worked with. It does things that no other text-based
  word processor can do, even if you are writing complex scientific
  reports. VS code has an extension which brings less than 5% of Org
  mode functionality, tops and that is mostly the code highlighting."
  #+end_quote

* Thanks! End of term! (Dec 16, 2021)

  I've recorded a short [[https://youtu.be/IxyqEW9-12s][good-bye video]] and distributed detailed end of
  course notes for each of my three classes, my first term at
  Lyon. Looking forward to spring 2022!

  #+attr_html: :width 500px

* Join me in spring 2022! (Nov 3)

  [[./img/dog.gif]]

  I've got around to writing down some of the things I'd like to do in
  my spring 2022 courses. Knowing that y'all wanting to pick your
  courses, I'm going to pin [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/spring22.md][these notes]] to the board outside my office
  (or you can [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/spring22.pdf][print this PDF]] and distribute it among your friends and
  family :-).

  Reading through the list of planned topics, I already know that I
  won't be able to cover everything listed here, but an instructor can
  have dreams, right?

  [[./img/algorithm.gif]]

  If I were you, I'd have difficulty deciding which course to take! As
  someone interested specifically in *data science*, I think both DSC
  205 (machine learning) and CSC 330 (databases and SQL) are
  important.

  The other two - C/C++ and Operating Systems - are perhaps more
  relevant for computer science students, or for anyone interested in
  gaining greater control over computers (which you should all want to
  do!). These are also courses about computational literacy, since
  system programming (which is what these courses are about) is
  constantly changing - and the number of people who know anything
  about it is dwindling - so these are highly marketable skills.

  No matter what you may think: you can handle the algorithms!

* Linux app under Windows (Oct 22)

  Thanks to our IT services member (and CompSci student) Brittany,
  I've now got Linux running under Windows 10 as an app from the
  Microsoft store. This is pretty neat and fast, and beats PowerShell,
  because now I have easy access to ~bash~ (command line shell), ~gcc~
  (C/C++ compiler), and even Emacs (though ~-nw~, that is without
  X-Windows, but that's fine, I prefer the downgraded version that
  forces you to know the keystrokes instead of having to move back and
  forth between keyboard and mouse). The path to getting this app to
  run is, alas, not for the faint-hearted. Brittany sketched it for
  me - try this on your machine[fn:4]!

** Download Linux

   Type ~Microsoft store~ in the search bar (next to the task bar),
   and then search for ~Ubuntu~ in the search field inside the
   store. You find different distributions. Pick ~Ubuntu 20.04
   LTS~[fn:5] and click on ~Get~ to download the installer. The
   distribution will take about 0.5 GB disk space.

   /Image: info about the distribution from Canonical/
   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[./img/Ubuntu.png]]

   When I tried to launch this app, I got an error due to Windows
   security settings, since you're messing with the system level here
   (so this does make sense).

** Turn Developer Mode On

   Go to the Windows search bar and look for ~Windows Security
   Settings~. The following page will open.

   /Image: Windows Security settings/
   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[./img/ubuntu1.png]]

   Find the developers menu point on the left hand side and open the
   menu. In this menu, ~Developer Mode~ needs to be turned ~On~ as
   shown in the image below.

   /Image: Windows Security Settings for Developers/
   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[./img/ubuntu2.png]]

** Enable Windows subsystem for Linux

   Go to the Windows search bar and look for ~Turn Windows features on
   or off~. A screen pops up. Scroll down until you see ~Windows
   Subsystem for Linux~. This allows Linux to take a portion of the
   system disk for itself (I think). Check this option as shown below.

   When saving this menu with ~OK~, you'll be prompted to restart the
   computer. After you did this, you should be able to boot Linux
   using the app.
* Transitioning to Windows 10 (Oct 9)

  The 2019 Dell Latitude laptop (running Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS) that
  I had brought from Germany, whose keyboard always reminded me of
  home, went on the fritz with some unrecoverable RAM error. I'm not
  too impressed with the lifetime, but then again, I put the little
  guy through a stress test. It may be that the RAM came lose - I'd
  have to open it to make sure, which I may do.

  However, this was also a great opportunity to finally move to my
  Lyon 2021 Dell Precision laptop - a heavy computing beast. At first,
  I had wanted to dump Windows for Linux but then some of your
  comments rang in my ears from past courses, and I experienced
  students' difficulties of Windows + R myself: it seemed appropriate
  to share their development burden and get off my high Linux
  horse[fn:6]. Also, here was an opportunity to try Emacs + ESS +
  Org-Mode + R as a bundle and perhaps bring some students with me to
  the bright side!

  I also work with GitHub Desktop now - this is an app, not the
  command line (hence it has a lot less flexibility, like all graphic
  environments), but it's Okay for my limited use of GitHub (namely,
  developing scripts and text files and sharing them in the cloud -
  something that I could achieve with GDrive). The reason why we use
  GitHub is (a) to get to know it (most prominent development
  environment), and (b) because it's much easier to follow/suggest
  changes in my source code via forks and issues. Some students seem
  to have forked my repos, but so far nobody has submitted an issue.

  The installation of [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md#org6e00b83][Emacs + ESS + R as a scientific stats IDE]][fn:7], and
  the installation and [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md#orgf34e53d][use of GitHub Desktop]] are subject of two new
  FAQs. Let me know how you get on with these - in the data science
  course (where I also work with Google Colaboratory), we may take
  some time to go through these instructions[fn:8]

* Florida Man (Oct 5)
** Gratitude

   I'm very grateful for fall break: it's given me my first opportunity
   for a vacation in over 2 years. Here's me looking quizzically into
   the future (taken in Pensacola, FL, over the weekend[fn:9]):

   #+attr_html: :width 600px

** Grading
   Back home, I'm procrastinating: need to finish grading tests for two
   courses, and setting midterm grades for three. I'm like a freshman:
   these are my first midterms. In Germany, where I taught before Lyon,
   students don't get any information on how they're doing during the
   term. Reality often comes crashing down hard on them only at the
   very end when it's too late. While I welcome this helpful attitude,
   it also makes students a little less independent: if you're not told
   how you're doing you have to ask the teacher (which is
   uncomfortable), and question yourself honestly. Both of these
   actions can help build skills that are useful later. Though many
   companies have elaborate feedback structures, official feedback
   often comes too late and is watered down as all standardized
   procedures are. Here is a quick look at the horror of such a
   standard, a "[[https://www.dm.usda.gov/employ/employeerelations/docs/Guide-ExPerfPlans.pdf][performance appraisal plan]]," if you don't know what I
   am talking about. As a manager, I spent a lot of time with similar
   tools, and I remain unconvinced of their actual value to the
   employee and to the company. /Image: German assessment
   center[fn:10]./

** Ghost of Tsushima

   I've come back to this game on the new PS5, and it's fantastic: the
   mechanics of this game are so incredibly precise. I used to be a
   fencer in my youth, and the swordplay in "Ghost of Tsushima" is so
   close to the truth that I find myself remembering moves and parries
   from decades ago. Also, playing on "lethal" level (since this is my
   2nd playthrough) is almost as challenging as a "Souls" game (like
   Demon Souls, Dark Souls or Bloodborne): every single boss encounter
   needs to be studied, and it takes me 10 or more attempts to get
   anywhere (often more than that). It's wonderfully frustrating but
   of course also eats up time, which is why long game play is limited
   to the holidays. /Image: one of those boss duels./

** Game of life

   Not just gaming, but science also continously generates
   distractions, because so much interesting stuff is going on,
   especially in my areas of interest (data science and machine
   learning). Just in time for a session on "literate programming" (in
   the data science intro course), and another session on "future of
   AI" (in the AI seminar), Lex Fridman has interviewed comp sci hero
   Donald Knuth for the second time - you should check out [[https://lexfridman.com/donald-knuth-2/][the podcast]]
   ([[fridman][Fridman, 2021]]) (also available on youtube). It's long (an
   excellent distraction), but the length is necessary to really go
   deep (this is one of Fridman's specialties, and much needed in this
   time of short attention spans and fleeting
   attractions)[fn:11]. There's also a [[https://thenewstack.io/donald-knuth-on-machine-learning-and-the-meaning-of-life/][summary]] of the long interview if
   you have little time or patience but a need for soundbites and
   essence.

   Then conversation between Knuth and Fridman meanders to an
   enticing parallel between AI and God:

   #+begin_quote
   “It’s only for me, and — but I but I personally think of my belief
   that God exists, although I have no idea what that means. But I
   believe that there is something beyond human capabilities — and it
   might be some AI, but whatever, but I do believe that there is
   something that goes beyond the realm of human understanding, that I
   can try to learn more about how to resonate with, whatever that
   being would like me to do.” --[[knuth][Donald Knuth]]
   #+end_quote

   I'm tempted to present this as the opening statement of tomorrow's
   session of the AI seminar...

* Relevance of agile methodologies (Sept 14)

  Students in all of my classes work with agile methodologies. This
  week, the first sprint reviews are due. Here is some motivation to
  learn this stuff and to do it well:

  #+begin_quote
  "Bloomberg uses the Agile methodology, which has become common in the
  tech industry for application development. The main advantage of the
  Agile methodology is that it creates an interactive communication
  line between the business and engineering teams to iteratively
  deliver value." (Source: [[datacamp][DataCamp, 8/30/2021]])
  #+end_quote

* Learning is like (physical) exercise (Sept 8)

  Read this today in an article in WIRED magazine, "How to Ace
  Physics Class (Even if You Don't Ace Physics)" ([[wired][Allain, 2021]]):

  #+begin_quote
  "Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that learning can be
  fun, but it can also be hard and confusing. Think of it like exercise:
  The more you sweat, the more you gain. You won't get faster and
  stronger by watching videos of people working out; you actually have
  to do something. And remember, it’s OK to be confused. Confusion is
  just the sweat of learning."
  #+end_quote

  Having studied physics and earned a PhD somehow, this makes sense
  to me. The "watching videos won't help" resonates with me, too:
  there were none, when I was a student, and it reminds me of Sheldon
  Cooper in that Big Bang Theory show where he gets a bloody nose
  because he thinks he can ride a bike after watching YouTube videos
  about it[fn:12].

  Anyway, I wouldn't overstate the importance of confusion - some
  confusion comes from badly written textbooks, badly taught classes,
  confused instructors etc. - generally, the more mathematical a
  topic and a presentation, the less space there should be for
  confusion. There is also "creative confusion", which one
  experiences e.g. when stumped by a problem. This is really
  important to feel! If you never feel it, you're either a genius or
  you're not trying hard enough (you'd know if you're a genius).

* KILT Lyon College Radio (Sunday, 29 August 2021)

  Listened to "[[https://lyonradio.weebly.com/programming-schedule.html][Lamplight]]", an evening with classical music, by Prof
  Oriatti, and had a great time while preparing classes and,
  intermittently, exchanging emails with the radio host. I really love
  that Lyon has its own radio station. Must come up with some format
  (podcast?) on data science. If anyone has an idea, let me know. I've
  always wanted to be on the radio. Though a classical music show is
  very hard to beat. Oriatti presented a marvelous selection and was
  totally responsive to the listeners. He even mentioned data science!

* Games and the Arkansas Experience (Saturday, 28 August 2021)
** Student projects
   I survived the 2nd week, too. Despite my reservations about the
   masks and all that, rapport is building and classes are getting more
   active. Found out that students are not used to writing long essays,
   and adjusted my expectations accordingly. That wasn't too hard since
   I don't like to read long essays! Next week is all about setting up
   the different projects - for an Exploratory Data Analysis project in
   DSC 101, for an essay on data modeling for DSC 482.02, and for an AI
   application project for DSC 482.01. I'm really looking forward to
   seeing what the students come up with. In many ways, data science is
   coming to a head - cp. the data vs. modeling debate kicked off by
   Andrew Ng, which cuts across the subjects of all three courses.

** Games industry in Arkansas?

   I had a nice conversation with an internship student, who turned
   out to like similar video games like I - the Dark Souls series, and
   other titles. From what she told me, there may be quite a pool of
   students at Lyon interested in video games. I'm inspired to think
   about ways in which one could use this talent for a gaming industry
   startup. This could be fun, and it could potentially be great for
   Lyon and for Batesville. There already is a thriving esports
   program at the college, and this might fit right in. Also: I need
   to get my hands on a PS5!

** Community

   On a losely related note: I got my Arkansas drivers license today!
   Beginning to feel like a full member of this community. Also: very
   impressed with the administrative processes all around. Getting
   your license in Germany is a major headache. Weeks later, they send
   it to you via surface mail. In Batesville, you present your
   documents, do a visual test, and minutes later you walk out, a
   freshly printed license and full ID in hand. It's a little like
   moving from a Kafka novel into a story where suddenly everything
   makes a little more sense.

** How to make the most of your internship

   For those interested in an internship, or already working
   somewhere - I believe that you might benefit from my internship
   course (and you can also pick up 1-2 credits). It involves weekly
   meetings of an hour in my office (currently on Fridays at 12 PM). a
   brief, informal presentation of your workplace and internship, and
   short, weekly blog posts on topics relevant to your internship. The
   course prepares you for the transition from college to work. Talk
   to me if you want to know more, or come to a Friday meeting. Don't
   just go to work and let this opportunity to learn go to waste!
* End of first week (Sunday, 22 August 2021)

  I'm pretty satisfied with the first week of classes - managed to get
  quite a bit of interesting content into each orientation session -
  enough for tests at the start at the 2nd week, and for six follow-up
  files. Three syllabi written though the schedules will be changing a
  lot - I've only been able to cover 30% of my material in the
  available time (story of my life, really).

  Students are still a little reluctant to participate - I wouldn't be
  any different myself with a brand new instructor. The masks are not
  helping, of course. Harder to build rapport for me - I don't know if
  my interventions are working, if my jokes are funny, and if my
  lectures leave an impression. The eyes as the "windows of the soul"
  are definitely overrated in the classroom.

  Perhaps this is for the best, because this way I may stop myself
  from talking too much, and the masks insulate the students from one
  another. Not quite as much as sitting at home during an online
  session, but enough to reduce intra-group distractions.

  Things I love: the support and the positive feeling all around -
  everybody wants to make this term work, everybody delivers or does
  their best - under such circumstances, it is easy to give one's
  best, too. My office. The heat! Batesville!

  I have two new lectures to finish ("What is AI?" and "What is a
  model?"), so I must be off, but I'll be seeing you soon. Tonight:
  takeaway - first Chinese buffet.

* GitHub & Cybersecurity (Sunday, 11 July 2021)
** GitHub
   Opted for GitHub as the course platform since I may be arriving too
   late to get up to scratch with Lyon's "Schoology" platform. Pro:
   opportunity to include Git and GitHub in the course. Con: separate
   platform. Another plus - just discovered that Emacs Org-mode renders
   as Markdown automatically[fn:13].

   Figured out how to link the GitHub remote repository (~master~) and
   the local repo (~origin~) and update the remote repo from the command
   line. In the end, however, I resorted to drag-and-drop addition of the
   org-file in question ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/blob/main/1_overview/1_overview.org][1_overview.org]][fn:14]), because I could not update the
   file inside the ~1_overview~ directory remotely. The best (fastest)
   solution would be to set up remote services using Emacs' [[https://magit.vc/][magit]].

   Instead of a forum, students can raise ~Issues~ in GitHub for
   discussion. This is just as good as a forum - except that the
   infrastructure is not protected and private. But this also helps to
   teach the students netiquette and data literacy when being online in a
   professional capacity.

** Cybersecurity

   Came back from Hamburg yesterday (family good-bye). Interesting
   conversation with a taxi driver on the way from the train station: he
   does not own a phone and entrusts anything personal only to
   handwritten notes. If he wants to share something personal with his
   friends or family at a distance, he writes a letter by hand and mails
   it via "snail mail" as it used to be called (does it still?). He's
   been "radicalized" in a way by media reports and books like this one
   by Harvard's Carissa Veliz, "[[https://www.harvard.com/book/privacy_is_power/][Privacy is Power: Why and How You Should
   Take Back Control of Your Data]]"[fn:15]. This made me think, once again,
   that it might be neat to focus on cybersecurity and create a course
   offering a couple of terms down the line. I recently read this 2020
   book on "[[https://www.packtpub.com/product/cyber-warfare-truth-tactics-and-strategies/9781839216992][Cyber Warfare-Truth, Tactics, and Strategies]]", which is far
   out, in some areas. Also interesting: AI and Cybersecurity, which is
   an active area of industry (see e.g. [[https://www.ibm.com/security/artificial-intelligence][at IBM]]), and which I will discuss
   in the AI seminar, also in this term.

   Next stop: syllabus!

* Footnotes

[fn:16]This quote supposedly comes from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasios_Papoulis][Athanasios Papoulis]], an
engineer and mathematician (1921-2002).

[fn:1]Don't get the digital version, get the paperback, because this
is a book that you'll want to work through, mark passages, leaf
through etc. It's a companion, not just a resource.

[fn:3]I'll always smoothen my diagrams with with
~ascii-art-to-unicode~ adjunct to ~artist-mode~ as explained in this
post earlier, and I won't especially mention this.

[fn:2] A vignette is a manual page for a software package.

[fn:5] This is the most recent Long Term Support (LTS - supported
until 2025) version of Ubuntu Linux, a popular, well supported
distribution. I mainly picked it also because I've worked with Ubuntu
18.04 LTS before.

[fn:4]If you attend my "operating systems" or "C/C++ programming"
courses, you'll have to do this anyway, since there's no way around
Linux in my classes - I just love it too much, and you must learn it.

[fn:7]In fact the Emacs distribution I found has a bunch of fantastic
software on board, including AUCTeX (a version of the typesetting
system TeX), and secure network communications that allow to use Emacs
as a news or email client, too (though this is not something I do).

[fn:6]If you want both Linux and Windows 10, you can either install
Linux in a VirtualBox (open source software owned by Oracle), or run a
dual boot system. But I already know Linux well, and my interest is to
have the most productive, most efficient work environment - so if I
cannot have Linux for that, then at least I can get the inside track
of students' (and many other peoples') pains with Windows. Though as I
am writing this, I am struggling with my feelings: it seems really
hard to get LaTeX for Windows, which means it's hard to generate PDFs
(except by generating HTML code and then printing it as PDF). There
are many reasons, why [[https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vs-linux-mint-2200609][Linux is better than Windows]].

[fn:8]As part of the session on literate programming and (later)
package and code development in R. Of course, there is also always
RStudio, but that's a commercial solution (freemium model)
increasingly wed to the "tidyverse", which I find increasingly
unsuitable (see the update of Matloff's "TidyverseSceptic" essay.

[fn:11] Fridman is a Russian machine learning expert from MIT, and if
you know Russians then you know that they tend to extremes (ever read
Tolstoy? Dostoyevsky?). I love this though I can only take so much of
it - I like that fact that it's different from what everyone does, and
I like the result that Fridman gets with his method. You should check
out some of his other podcasts, e.g. with Elon Musk.

[fn:10]An assessment center is an event where many applicants are
simultaneously assessed for their suitability. It usually lasts longer
(one day or more) and involves solo and team exercises, interviews,
etc. The whole thing is often observed by senior members of the
company or organization. Naturally, all challenges are standardized.

[fn:9]This is a 10-hour drive from Batesville, AR. In Germany, 10
hours get you from Flensburg in the North (on the Danish border) to
Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the Alps (on the border to Austria). That's
as far as you can go in Germany, and in the Southlands, it gets you to
the nearest beach. The route goes through 5 different states, which is
great fun for a recent immigrant. Linda the friendly, boring Google
maps bot, announces each state, "Welcome in Alabama" etc.). You'd
think that I'd be knackered after driving for 20 hours but actually, I
am not, quite the opposite, I'm rather energized by the experience!

[fn:12]That (early) trust in the Internet is both endearing and
endangering. Endangering, because our brains don't have a switch or a
safety valve that reacts to fake Internet content, we are its
victims. Endearing, because so many people (I wanted to know how many
but I couldn't find reliable statistics - data science project!?)
upload helpful information for complete strangers.

[fn:15]An excerpt from this book might become an assignment for this
course and/or for the AI seminar.

[fn:14]Org-mode insight: to switch off automatic replacement of
sub/superscripts, add the line ~#+OPTIONS: ^:nil~ at startup.

[fn:13]Though the wiki pages cannot be added, they have to be exported
into Markdown, which is a bit of work. Note to self: automate workflow!
