#+begin_quote
A solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Earth and
the Sun, blocking all or part of the Sun's light from reaching the Earth.

This can only happen during a new moon, when Sun and Moon are in
conjunction as seen from Earth.
#+end_quote
* How often does a solar eclipse happen?
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[./img/national_geographic.png]]

#+begin_quote
Solar eclipses happen 2-5 times a year, total solar eclipses once
every 18 months somewhere on Earth. Any given location on Earth
might experience a solar eclipse only once every few hundred years.
#+end_quote
Is predicting solar eclipses difficult?
#+begin_notes
The classical basis of the prediction of the celestial positions of
Sun, Moon and Earth is a three-body-problem. There is no general
solution to this problem that applies to all possible initial
conditions.

The two-body-problem was solved by Isaac Newton in the late 17th
century. This led to the laws of motion and universal gravitation and
laid the foundation for classical mechanics and enabled precise
calculations of celestial motion, including the orbits of planets.
#+end_notes
* Why were the total solar eclipses 2017 and 2024 so close to one another?
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[./img/2017_2024.png]]
#+begin_quote
The path of totality in 2017 moved from NW to SE, in 2024 from SW
to NE. Timing between eclipses vary due to the complex geometry of
Earth-Moon-Sun alignments and the cycle of eclipses ('Saros cycle').

* What does "data visualization" mean?
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[./img/rp-overview.jpg]]
#+begin_quote
'Data visualization' is one step in the data science workflow,
which includes: data gathering, data import, data cleaning, data
transformation, and data modeling.
#+end_quote
* What is the difference between a "visualization" and "data visualization"?
#+begin_quote
Data visualization is a scientific process: it involves using real
historic (descriptive) or future (predicted) data, information
about the origin of the data, a location where the data can be
inspected,
#+end_quote
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[./img/xkcd_devices.png]]

This is "just" a visualization (though a fun one, and one that is
rooted in common human experience - but the visualization makes no
claim to be scientific or systematic).

- Science is a fickle mistress though. And when it comes to computer
  and data science, it's not very different from an honest craft. To
  fix a car (photo), you also need long training and apprenticeship.

* What are interesting "solar eclipse" visualizations?
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[./img/batesville.png]]
#+begin_quote
1. *The path of totality* - that is the path on Earth along which the
   Sun is totally blocked by the Moon. On April 8, 2024, Batesville
   AR lies in this path for a total time of 4 minutes 1.7
   seconds. Examples:
   - NASA, Scientific Visualization Studio: [[https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEplot/SEplot2001/SE2024Apr08T.GIF][Orthographic map]] showing
     many details; [[https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEanimate/SEanimate2001/SE2024Apr08T.GIF][animated Gif]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saros_(astronomy)#/media/File:Saros15122015.gif][Saros cycle animation]].
   - [[https://www.suncalc.org/#/35.7719,-91.6427,8/2024.02.23/20:50/1/3][SunCalc.org]]: path computation with solar eclipse data for
     Batesville from 1500 B.C. to 3000 A.D.
   - [[https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1Hnwl6iLY8XveFnBixXx9IkY8mys&hl=en_US&ll=35.69816899247008%2C-92.05700536845772&z=8][Google maps:]] different lines of the path.
2. *Population impact*: how many people are in the path of
   totality. You need to add data sources to map approximate
   population density. See for example ([[https://www.astronomy.com/observing/astronomys-atlas-maps-totality/][Zeiler, 2024]]).
3. *Historical eclipse paths*: comparing the 2024 path with
   historical eclipse paths over the same region to explore
   frequency, duration and path. For example from [[https://eclipsophile.com/ghosts/][eclipsophile.com]].
4. *Interactive maps*: users can zoom in and out and explore specific
   locations. For example [[https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1Hnwl6iLY8XveFnBixXx9IkY8mys&hl=en_US&ll=35.69816899247008%2C-92.05700536845772&z=8][Google Maps]].
5. *Astronomical phenomena*: visualizing the timing and positioning
   of other celestial bodies during the eclipse could add depth to
   the understanding of the event. E.g. [[https://starwalk.space/en/news/astronomy-calendar-2024][starwalk.space]],
   Astronomical Events 2024.
6. *Climatology and weather forecast*: weather planning for eclipse
   day, for example [[https://eclipsophile.com/][eclipsophile.com]].

* What is interesting the history of solar eclipse exploration?
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[./img/antikythera.jpg]]
#+begin_quote
1. *Ancient Observations:* Historical records from various
   civilizations, including the Babylonians, Greeks, and Chinese,
   provide evidence of solar eclipse observations, underscoring
   their importance in early astronomical studies. (E.g. as
   described by Herodotus during the Battle of Halys 585 BC when
   the sudden darkness was interpreted as a divine sign for peace).

2. *Scientific Milestones:* Solar eclipses have played pivotal roles
   in key scientific discoveries, including the validation of
   Einstein's theory of general relativity during the 1919 eclipse:
   Einstein had postulated that space was not the same in all
   directions but that gravity of large bodies could bend rays of
   light. Eddington measured the position of stars near the Sun's
   edge during an eclipse providing empirical evidence for the
   theory.

3. *Technological Advancements:* The study of solar eclipses has
   driven advancements in astronomical instruments and
   observational techniques, enhancing our understanding of the Sun
   and its influence on Earth. Example: the Antikythera from 100 BC
   (named after the Greek island where it was found in 1901), the
   earliest known analog computer designed to predict eclipses
   decades in advance.

4. *Cultural Impact:* Eclipses have significantly impacted human
   culture, inspiring myths, influencing religions, and
   contributing to our fascination with the cosmos. E.g. in Viking
   mythology, eclipses were explained as the sky wolf, Skoll,
   catching and devouring the Sun.

** Data
#+attr_html: :width 400px:

[[./img/data.png]]

- All data visualizations start with data. You can get the date,
  time, and location of every solar eclipses of the past 5,000
  years from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center as a CSV file
  ([[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/solar-eclipses/data][Arvidsson, 2023]]).

- You can also get the path data for the total solar eclipse of
  2024 on April 8 from NASA ([[https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEpath/SEpath2001/SE2024Apr08Tpath.html][Espenak, 2014]]). You have to
  'scrape' these data from the web page (which can be tricky).
** Tools

Such as: programming languages like R or Python, data visualization
software like Tableau, or symbolic languages like Wolfram Language.

Let's do some actual coding with R:
1) Importing the data into two data frames ~Solar~ and ~Lunar~.
2) Analyzing the data - looking for structure and statistics.
3) Plotting the data.

*** Importing and transforming the data

After importing, we change some column names to ease analysis:
#+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both :noweb yes
  ## Store downloaded CSV data in dataframes
  solar <- read.csv("data/solar.csv", header = TRUE,stringsAsFactor=TRUE)
  lunar <- read.csv("data/lunar.csv", header = TRUE,stringsAsFactor=TRUE)

  ## correct header names for better display
  selection <- c(2,3,7,12,13,16)
  names(lunar)[selection] <- c('date','time','type','lat','lon','tot')
  head(lunar)[selection]

- How many total solar eclipses were recorded in ~lunar.csv~, what was
  the longest and what was the shortest total solar eclipse? What is
  the first and the last recorded one?
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both :noweb yes
    ## Filter for total solar eclipses, converting factors to characters as necessary
    total_eclipses <- subset(lunar, grepl("T", as.character(type)))

    ## Count the total number of total solar eclipses
    total_count <- nrow(total_eclipses)

    ## Convert duration to numeric while handling potential NA values
    ## Assuming 'tot' was imported as a factor because of stringsAsFactors=TRUE
    total_eclipses$tot <- as.numeric(as.character(total_eclipses$tot))

    ## Find the longest and shortest total solar eclipse durations
    longest_eclipse_duration <- max(total_eclipses$tot, na.rm = TRUE)
    shortest_eclipse_duration <- min(total_eclipses$tot, na.rm = TRUE)

    ## Sort the total eclipses by date, converting factors to characters if necessary
    total_eclipses_sorted <- total_eclipses[order(as.character(total_eclipses$date)), ]

    ## Get the first and last recorded total solar eclipses
    first_recorded_eclipse <- total_eclipses_sorted[1, ]
    last_recorded_eclipse <- total_eclipses_sorted[nrow(total_eclipses_sorted), ]

    ## Print the results
    cat("Total Solar Eclipses:", total_count, "\n")
    cat("Longest Eclipse Duration (minutes):", longest_eclipse_duration, "\n")
    cat("Shortest Eclipse Duration (minutes):", shortest_eclipse_duration, "\n")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Total Solar Eclipses: 3479
  : Longest Eclipse Duration (minutes): 106.6
  : Shortest Eclipse Duration (minutes): 1.7

- According to the datasheet from [[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/solar-eclipses/data][Kaggle]], Earth will experience 12064
  lunar and 11898 solar eclipses. Data exploration must continue with
  an explanation of this discrepancy!

- Is the 2024, April 8 total solar eclipse contained in this dataset?
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both :noweb yes
    ## Find the 2024 April 8 eclipse
    april_8_2024_eclipse <- subset(lunar, as.character(date) == "2024-04-08")

    ## Check if the eclipse is in the data
    if(nrow(april_8_2024_eclipse) > 0) {
      cat("Data for the 2024 April 8 eclipse:\n")
      print(april_8_2024_eclipse)
    } else {
      cat("The 2024 April 8 eclipse is not in the dataset.\n")
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : The 2024 April 8 eclipse is not in the dataset.

- This could be because we were looking at the lunar and not at the
  solar eclipse dataset, or because we got the date format wrong (this
  is the case: the dataframe date format is not "YYYY-MM-DD").

- We're out of time for now, but there's still work to be done before
  we can begin to think about plotting.

*** Plotting the data

An interesting plot would be to see if total solar eclipses happen
more often in the Northern or in the Southern hemisphere.

Here  is a plot from NASA. This is easy to do in R or Python as well.

Understanding of what you want to show and whom to show it to: a clear
objective and a specific audience.

- Data never exist out of context. To invest time into gathering,
  importing, transforming, analysing and visualizing data, we must
  first convince ourselves of the relevance of our research question.

- There is no "data science for its own sake", though there can be
  surprise discoveries in the data (i.e. answers to questions not
  asked, patterns not suspected before, etc.).

- An example is the observation of helium in the Sun's atmosphere
  during the solar eclipse of August 18, 1868. Astronomers observed a
  yellow spectral line in the light from the Sun's chromosphere during
  the eclipse. This observation could not be explained by any known
  chemical elements at that time. Turns out it was "helium" (after the
  Greek god of the Sun, Helios), which was only found on Earth 27
  years after its initial discovery in the solar spectrum.

- The image shows Fraunhofer lines - dark absorption lines that
  correspond to different chemical elements.
