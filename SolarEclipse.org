* Data Science for Everyone - Visualizing the Solar Eclipse

Questions and answers:
1) How does a solar eclipse happen?
   #+begin_quote
   A solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Earth and
   the Sun, blocking all or part of the Sun's light from reaching the Earth.

   This can only happen during a new moon, when Sun and Moon are in
   conjunction as seen from Earth.
   #+end_quote
2) How often does a solar eclipse happen?
   #+begin_quote
   Solar eclipses happen 2-5 times a year, total solar eclipses once
   every 18 months somewhere on Earth. Any given location on Earth
   might experience a solar eclipse only once every few hundred years.
   #+end_quote
3) Why were the total solar eclipses 2017 and 2024 so close to one another?
   #+begin_quote
   The path of totality in 2017 moved from NW to SE, in 2024 from SW
   to NE. Timing between eclipses vary due to the complex geometry of
   Earth-Moon-Sun alignments and the cycle of eclipses ('Saros cycle').

4) What does "data visualization" mean?
   #+begin_quote
   'Data visualization' is one step in the data science workflow,
   which includes: data gathering, data import, data cleaning, data
   transformation, and data modeling.
   #+end_quote
5) What is the difference between a "visualization" and "data
   visualization"?
   #+begin_quote
   Data visualization is a scientific process: it involves using real
   historic (descriptive) or future (predicted) data, information
   about the origin of the data, a location where the data can be
   inspected,

6) What are interesting "solar eclipse" visualizations?
   #+begin_quote
   1. *The path of totality* - that is the path on Earth along which the
      Sun is totally blocked by the Moon. On April 8, 2024, Batesville
      AR lies in this path for a total time of 4 minutes 1.7
      seconds. Examples:
      - NASA, Scientific Visualization Studio: [[https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEplot/SEplot2001/SE2024Apr08T.GIF][Orthographic map]]
        showing many details; [[https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEanimate/SEanimate2001/SE2024Apr08T.GIF][animated Gif]]
      - [[https://www.suncalc.org/#/35.7719,-91.6427,8/2024.02.23/20:50/1/3][SunCalc.org]]: path computation with solar eclipse data for
        Batesville from 1500 B.C. to 3000 A.D.
      - [[https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1Hnwl6iLY8XveFnBixXx9IkY8mys&hl=en_US&ll=35.69816899247008%2C-92.05700536845772&z=8][Google maps:]] different lines of the path.
   2. *Population impact*: how many people are in the path of
      totality. You need to add data sources to map approximate
      population density. See for example ([[https://www.astronomy.com/observing/astronomys-atlas-maps-totality/][Zeiler, 2024]]).
   3. *Historical eclipse paths*: comparing the 2024 path with
      historical eclipse paths over the same region to explore
      frequency, duration and path. For example from [[https://eclipsophile.com/ghosts/][eclipsophile.com]].
   4. *Interactive maps*: users can zoom in and out and explore specific
      locations. For example [[https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1Hnwl6iLY8XveFnBixXx9IkY8mys&hl=en_US&ll=35.69816899247008%2C-92.05700536845772&z=8][Google Maps]].
   5. *Astronomical phenomena*: visualizing the timing and positioning
      of other celestial bodies during the eclipse could add depth to
      the understanding of the event. E.g. [[https://starwalk.space/en/news/astronomy-calendar-2024][starwalk.space]],
      Astronomical Events 2024.
   6. *Climatology and weather forecast*: weather planning for eclipse
      day, for example [[https://eclipsophile.com/][eclipsophile.com]].

7) What is interesting the history of solar eclipse exploration?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Ancient Observations: Historical records from various
      civilizations, including the Babylonians, Greeks, and Chinese,
      provide evidence of solar eclipse observations, underscoring
      their importance in early astronomical studies. (E.g. as
      described by Herodotus during the Battle of Halys 585 BC when
      the sudden darkness was interpreted as a divine sign for peace).

   2. Scientific Milestones: Solar eclipses have played pivotal roles
      in key scientific discoveries, including the validation of
      Einstein's theory of general relativity during the 1919 eclipse:
      Einstein had postulated that space was not the same in all
      directions but that gravity of large bodies could bend rays of
      light. Eddington measured the position of stars near the Sun's
      edge during an eclipse providing empirical evidence for the
      theory.

   3. Technological Advancements: The study of solar eclipses has
      driven advancements in astronomical instruments and
      observational techniques, enhancing our understanding of the Sun
      and its influence on Earth. Example: the Antikythera from 100 BC
      (named after the Greek island where it was found in 1901), the
      earliest known analog computer designed to predict eclipses
      decades in advance.
      
   4. Cultural Impact: Eclipses have significantly impacted human
      culture, inspiring myths, influencing religions, and
      contributing to our fascination with the cosmos. E.g. in Viking
      mythology, eclipses were explained as the sky wolf, Skoll,
      catching and devouring the Sun.

8) What do you need to have, know or learn to visualize the solar
   eclipse?
   #+begin_quote
   1. *Data*.
      - All data visualizations start with data. You can get the date,
        time, and location of every solar eclipses of the past 5,000
        years from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center as a CSV file
        ([[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/solar-eclipses/data][Arvidsson, 2023]]).
      - You can also get the path data for the total solar eclipse of
        2024 on April 8 from NASA ([[https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEpath/SEpath2001/SE2024Apr08Tpath.html][Espenak, 2014]]). You have to
        'scrape' these data from the web page (which can be tricky).
   2. *Tools*, such as R or Python, Tableau, or Wolfram Language.
      - Let's look at one example using ChatGPT integrated with the
        symbolic [[https://www.wolfram.com/language/][Wolfram language]] ([[https://chat.openai.com/g/g-0S5FXLyFN-wolfram/c/d528ebaf-3a0c-4176-8c0d-728292538c4b][WolframGPT]], [[https://www.wolframcloud.com/env/birkenkrahe/SolarEclipse.nb][WolframCloud]])
      - Let's do some actual coding with R:
        1) Download the Solar and Lunar Eclipse data.
        2) Importing the data into two data frames ~Solar~ and ~Lunar~.
        3) Analyzing the data a little.
        4) Visualizing some data.
           
   3. Understanding of what you want to show and whom to show it to: a
      clear objective and a specific audience.
