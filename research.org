* Objectives

The Data Science Independent Study aims to:

1. Deepen Understanding: Enhance students' grasp of key data science
   concepts, techniques, and tools.
2. Application: Enable practical application of data science theories
   to real-world challenges.
3. Research Proficiency: Develop research and problem-solving skills
   using diverse data sources and methodologies.
4. Advanced Tool Mastery: Foster proficiency in leading data science
   software and programming languages.
5. Critical Thinking: Promote the evaluation of complex datasets and
   models with a critical mindset.
6. Ethical Considerations: Emphasize responsible and ethical data
   usage, ensuring privacy and fairness.
7. Collaboration: Encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration,
   integrating insights from multiple perspectives.
8. Continuous Learning: Inculcate a habit of staying updated with
   evolving data science trends and technologies.
9. Project Management:
   Enhance abilities in initiating, executing, and presenting
   independent projects.
10. Communication: Develop skills in effectively communicating
    data-driven insights to diverse audiences.
    
This study encourages holistic data science exploration, promoting
both technical expertise and broader interdisciplinary connections.

* Target audience

This course is tailored for advanced students and professionals with
foundational knowledge in data science, statistics, or a related
field. Ideal participants are those eager to dive deeper into
specialized data topics, undertake independent research, and apply
theoretical concepts to real-world problems. The course will
especially benefit those aiming for careers as data scientists, data
analysts, or roles requiring rigorous data-driven
decision-making. Prior experience with programming languages such as
Python or R is beneficial but not mandatory, as the emphasis is on
exploration, critical thinking, and application.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Upon completion, students will:

1) Demonstrate advanced proficiency in key data science techniques and
   tools.
2) Apply data science concepts to solve real-world challenges.
3) Exhibit rigorous research and problem-solving abilities.
4) Critically evaluate and interpret complex datasets and models.
5) Adhere to ethical standards in data analysis and
   interpretation.
6) Collaborate effectively across disciplines,
   integrating diverse insights.
7) Stay abreast of current trends and technologies in data science.
8) Manage and execute data-driven projects from initiation to
   presentation.
9) Communicate data insights articulately to varied audiences.

* Course requirements

Students must possess:

- Foundational knowledge in data science or statistics.
- Familiarity with a programming language (preferably Python or R).
- A commitment to a semester-long research project.
- Regular attendance in consultation sessions.
- Engagement in peer reviews.
- Completion of ethical data usage training.
- Final project presentation.

* Grading system

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course. To pass, you need 60%.

| DESCRIPTION                  | IMPACT |
|------------------------------+--------|
| Final report                 |    50% |
| Final presentation           |    25% |
| Participation                |    25% |

* Learning Management System (LMS)

We will use Canvas and GitHub in this course.

* Schedule and session content

For *important dates*, see the academic Calendar at: catalog.lyon.edu.

Independent research does not follow a particular schedule but it is
instead aligned with the researchers' schedule and (if applicable)
deadlines for journal submissions or conferences.

* Standard and course policies

- *Standard Lyon College Policies* are incorporated into this syllabus
  and can be found at: [[http://www.lyon.edu/standard-course-policies][lyon.edu/standard-course-policies]].
