* Course description

In this course, you will complete a series of game, animation and
robotics projects using the visual, drag-and-drop programming language
Snap! and Python (for robotics) You will learn basic computer and data
science principles, and understand how computers help us control the
world around us. You will graduate from mere consumer and user to
powerful programmer while playing around with blocks on the
screen. Acquiring programming skills will help you develop your
critical thinking. We will meet daily for 90 minutes of practical
problem solving and interactive exercises. In between classes, you
will work on small assignments, and you will read short textbook
chapters or watch short instructional videos. You'll get to present
your own work and (optionally) publish your finished projects for the
whole world to see, and if things go well, perhaps we'll go to
Snap!Con in California next year!

* Learning Objectives

Students who complete "Games and Robotics Programming with Snap! and
Python" will be able to:

- Create exciting games, animation and media computation
- Learn computer and data science principles by playing with data
- Acquire basic sequential programming skills
- Know how to translate visual Snap! code into procedural Python code
- Know how to operate robots using simple instructions
- Understand the relationship of humans and machines better
- Develop their critical thinking skills
- Know how to effectively present assignment results

* Textbook (optional)
