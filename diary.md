# What is this?

A place for irregular articles of possible interest to students
across all courses, mostly to avoid lengthy emails and to park
content that I may want to develop later on time permitting.

# Sunday, 11 July 2021 - GitHub & Cybersecurity


## GitHub

Opted for GitHub as the course platform since I may be arriving too
late to get up to scratch with Lyon's "Schoology" platform. Pro:
opportunity to include Git and GitHub in the course. Con: separate
platform. Another plus - just discovered that Emacs Org-mode renders
as Markdown automatically<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.

Figured out how to link the GitHub remote repository (`master`) and
the local repo (`origin`) and update the remote repo from the command
line. In the end, however, I resorted to drag-and-drop addition of the
org-file in question ([1\_overview.org](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/blob/main/1_overview/1_overview.org)<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>), because I could not update the
file inside the `1_overview` directory remotely. The best (fastest)
solution would be to set up remote services using Emacs' [magit](https://magit.vc/).

Instead of a forum, students can raise `Issues` in GitHub for
discussion. This is just as good as a forum - except that the
infrastructure is not protected and private. But this also helps to
teach the students netiquette and data literacy when being online in a
professional capacity.


## Cybersecurity

Came back from Hamburg yesterday (family good-bye). Interesting
conversation with a taxi driver on the way from the train station: he
does not own a phone and entrusts anything personal only to
handwritten notes. If he wants to share something personal with his
friends or family at a distance, he writes a letter by hand and mails
it via "snail mail" as it used to be called (does it still?). He's
been "radicalized" in a way by media reports and books like this one
by Harvard's Carissa Veliz, "[Privacy is Power: Why and How You Should
Take Back Control of Your Data](https://www.harvard.com/book/privacy_is_power/)"<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. This made me think, once again,
that it might be neat to focus on cybersecurity and create a course
offering a couple of terms down the line. I recently read this 2020
book on "[Cyber Warfare-Truth, Tactics, and Strategies](https://www.packtpub.com/product/cyber-warfare-truth-tactics-and-strategies/9781839216992)", which is far
out, in some areas. Also interesting: AI and Cybersecurity, which is
an active area of industry (see e.g. [at IBM](https://www.ibm.com/security/artificial-intelligence)), and which I will discuss
in the AI seminar, also in this term.

Next stop: syllabus!

# Sunday, 22 July 2021 - End of first week

I'm pretty satisfied with the first week of classes - managed to get
quite a bit of interesting content into each orientation session -
enough for tests at the start at the 2nd week, and for six follow-up
files. Three syllabi written though the schedules will be changing a
lot - I've only been able to cover 30% of my material in the
available time (story of my life, really). 

Students are still a little reluctant to participate - I wouldn't be
any different myself with a brand new instructor. The masks are not
helping, of course. Harder to build rapport for me - I don't know if
my interventions are working, if my jokes are funny, and if my
lectures leave an impression. The eyes as the "windows of the soul"
are definitely overrated in the classroom. 

Perhaps this is for the best, because this way I may stop myself
from talking too much, and the masks insulate the students from one
another. Not quite as much as sitting at home during an online
session, but enough to reduce intra-group distractions.

Things I love: the support and the positive feeling all around -
everybody wants to make this term work, everybody delivers or does
their best - under such circumstances, it is easy to give one's
best, too. My office. The heat! Batesville!

I have two new lectures to finish ("What is AI?" and "What is a
model?"), so I must be off, but I'll be seeing you soon. Tonight:
takeaway - first Chinese buffet.


# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Though the wiki pages cannot be added, they have to be exported
into Markdown, which is a bit of work. Note to self: automate workflow!

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> Org-mode insight: to switch off automatic replacement of
sub/superscripts, add the line `#+OPTIONS: ^:nil` at startup.

<sup><a id="fn.3" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> An excerpt from this book might become an assignment for this
course and/or for the AI seminar.
