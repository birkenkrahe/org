* Objectives

Artificial intelligence has been a goal of computer science (CS)
since the early days of the field in the 1950s. Unlike other areas
of CS, it has undergone major trend swings. Currently, AI enjoys
another (its third) spring. In truth, though, AI is not just one
field, but several interconnected fields. In this seminar, we will
work together to identify and understand the AI subfields that are
industrially relevant, and separate them from the more arcane areas
that may, or may not be relevant in the near future. This special
topic seminar is for everyone who is interested in AI. We will
discuss algorithmic, social, philosophical, commercial and
technical aspects of AI.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete DSC 482.01 "Artificial Intelligence", will be
able to:

- understand the history and importance of AI for society
- know how to solve problems in complex environments
- know how AI can be used for sales and marketing
- understand agent-based technologies for different applications
- understand the conceptual basics of machine learning techniques
- design an own application using AI principles and techniques

* Course requirements

No prior knowledge required. Some knowledge of, and experience with
algorithms is useful but not critical. Curiosity is essential. You
will gain data literacy skills by taking this course. The course
will prepare you for further studies in machine learning and deep
learning, but also in conceptual applications of AI, like machine
ethics.

* Grading

| When   | Description          | Impact | Mode   |
|--------+----------------------+--------+--------|
| Weekly | DataCamp assignments |    25% | Single |
| TBD    | Presentation         |    25% | Single |
| TBD    | Session protocol     |    25% | Single |
| TBD    | AI application       |    25% | Team   |

Notes:
- To pass: 60%
- DataCamp assignments: there are 16 assignments spread out over 5
  courses. Each assignment contributes 1.5625% (25/16) to your final
  grade. Late assignments are counted as 60% complete only.
- Session protocol: every participant completes 1 protocol for the
  topical presentation of another participant.
- Presentation: by individual course participants on AI topics
  (articles and supervision from the instructor).
- AI application: a customer-focused team effort resulting in a new AI
  application using e.g. ChatGPT. Includes 4 Scrum sprint reviews.
