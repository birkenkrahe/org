     - In Emacs: C-h t
     - [[https://www.stolaf.edu/people/humke/UNIX/emacs-tutorial.html][HTML version]]
   * In class: Solve some sample editing problems

   Additional resources:
   * Here is a gentle, personal introduction [[https://youtu.be/1YOrd7NCGkg]["First Steps with Emacs"]]
     with a focus on using Emacs for data science (Eddelbuettel, 2021)
   * Here is a great article, [[https://opensource.com/article/20/3/getting-started-emacs]["Getting started with Emacs"]] (Kenlon, 2020).
   * Here is a long video with all the details "[[https://youtu.be/48JlgiBpw_I][The Absolute
     Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Emacs]]" (System Crafters, 2021). It's so good
     that [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs_beginner.org#absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs][I took notes]].

** Why

   * A lot of what goes on in Emacs is Unix stuff - commands carry
     over to the shell

   * Emacs is a small (ca. 1.5 mio lines of code[fn:1]), extensible,
     transparent operating system

   * It's a mellow start to our journey (stuff to do)
