** Overview

   * Installation
   * Guided tour
   * GNU Emacs onboard tutorial
     - In Emacs: C-h t
     - [[https://www.stolaf.edu/people/humke/UNIX/emacs-tutorial.html][HTML version]]
   * In class: Solve some sample editing problems

   Additional resources:
   * Here is a gentle, personal introduction [[https://youtu.be/1YOrd7NCGkg]["First Steps with Emacs"]]
     with a focus on using Emacs for data science (Eddelbuettel, 2021)
   * Here is a great article, [[https://opensource.com/article/20/3/getting-started-emacs]["Getting started with Emacs"]] (Kenlon, 2020).
   * Here is a long video with all the details "[[https://youtu.be/48JlgiBpw_I][The Absolute
     Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Emacs]]" (System Crafters, 2021). It's so good
     that [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs_beginner.org#absolute-beginners-guide-to-emacs][I took notes]].

** Why

   * A lot of what goes on in Emacs is Unix stuff - commands carry
     over to the shell

   * OS: Emacs is like a small (ca. 1.5 mio lines of code[fn:1]),
     extensible, transparent operating system

   * DB: an excellent way to explore data-oriented software

   * C/C++/R: interactive notebook programming

   * It's a mellow start to our journey (stuff to do)

** Install GNU Emacs

   * Already done for public PCs in Lyon 104

   * See install.org and install.pdf in GitHub if you want to do this
     on your laptop (you may have to in order to get better)
   
** Emacs Guided Tour & Tutorial

   - See also: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/
   - Emacs in a terminal (~emacs -nw~) - try it

*** Objectives

   * We will work through the beginning of the tutorial in class
     together.
   * You will gain fluency in using the keyboard shorts to control
     Emacs
   * You will no longer rely on the mouse
   * You will be able to run code inside Emacs
   * Some will be faster, some will be slower. Finish it at home!

*** Open the tutorial

   * The tutorial can be opened from the GNU Emacs start page: C-h t
   * To increase the font, type C-x C-= then +, -, or 0.
   * You can see the scale in the modeline next to the mode name

*** Control and Meta keys

    * On MacOS, the Meta key is the <Options> key (between CTRL and
      Apple key)
    * On Windows, the Meta key is the right <Alt> key.
    * If you type C-z (suspend-frame) in the terminal emacs, you get
      back to the command line (shell). To get back: fg RET
      (foreground)

*** Minibuffer & basic navigation

    * Starting emacs (~PATH~ variable)
    * Minibuffer: messages and input
    * Leaving Emacs with C-x C-c

*** Basic cursor control

*** Numeric arguments
*** Stopping and quitting Emacs
*** Disabled commands

*** Windows control (buffers/frames)

*** Inserting and deleting (yank/kill)

*** Undo

*** File management

*** Auto-save and recovery

*** Modeline

*** Modes

*** Searching

*** Multiple windows / frames

*** Getting more help

*** Custom themes and fonts

*** Initialization (~/.emacs~)

*** Packages

*** Shell inside Emacs
*** Org-mode

** Practice: solve some sample editing problems

*** Practice problem 1 - buffers

*** Practice problem 2 - insert/delete

*** Practice problem 3 - file management

*** Practice problem 4 - searching and counting
