# README

![img](../img/0_gnuemacs.png "Emacs logo <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>")

-   This is a makeshift Emacs tutorial for absolute beginners to enable
    you to do the most basic things with Emacs as your text editor.

-   For the best gain from this tutorial, open Emacs on the terminal
    (command line interface) with `emacs -nw -q` in non-graphics mode,
    without loading a customization file (like `.emacs` or `init.el`).

-   You should be able to complete this tutorial in less than 1 hr -
    likely less than half the time of the more comprehensive Emacs
    onboard tutorial (reachable e.g. from the startup screen).

-   Unlike the standard tutorial, this is an instruction file: you will
    do the editing in a separate text file whose content you will
    download.


<a id="org3fdf124"></a>

# Buffer and key basics

![img](../img/newfile.png "Inserting a text file into buffer with C-x i")

-   An Emacs **buffer** has three parts:
    -   The main **editing** area at the top (to edit text)
    -   The **mode line** below it (file and buffer information)
    -   The **minibuffer** at the bottom (for messages and input)

-   Most commands are bound to keys beginning with `C-` (CTRL), or `M-` (for
    "Meta", which is the `<ALT>` key on most keyboards).

-   For example, `C-x C-f` means: hold down CTRL and press x and f. `M-<`
    means: hold down `ALT` + `SHIFT` + `<` all at the same time.

-   Most commands are shown in the minibuffer (or *echo* area) so when you
    have compound commands like `C-x C-f`, you can check your progress.


<a id="org0f0188e"></a>

# The mode line - basic buffer movement

1.  Open a new file with `C-x C-f`. At the prompt, enter the file name:
    `tutor.txt` and press `<RET>`.

2.  Alternatively, you can also open the file directly from
    the command line: `emacs --file tutor.txt -nw -q`.

3.  The modeline shows (among other things):
    -   A few dashes to indicate the edit status (`----`)
    -   A file name (`tutor.txt`)
    -   How far down in the file you've come (`All` because it's empty)
    -   The line number your cursor is on (e.g. `L1`)
    -   The file mode (`Text`)

4.  Open a browser, open at [tinyurl.com/22rt7t2f](https://tinyurl.com/22rt7t2f) and save the file
    (with a mouse right-click) as `text.txt` in your downloads
    directory - `c:/User/yourname/Downloads`.

5.  In `tutor.txt`, enter `C-x i` and insert the file `text.txt` from its
    location, `Downloads`. If you mess up (at any time), type `C-g` to
    quit any command sequence:
    
    ![img](../img/0_text.png "After inserting a text file into buffer with C-x i")

6.  The mode line now indicates that the file has been changed: `**--`

7.  Save the file with `C-x C-s`. You should get a confirmation in the
    minibuffer, alongside the full path to the file - and the mode line
    changes to `----`:
    
        Wrote c:/Users/birkenkrahe/tutor.txt

8.  The text is saved as one long line. Go to the start of the line
    with `C-a`, then to the end with `C-e`.

9.  Go back on the line with `C-b`, and forward with `C-f` (one character),
    or with `M-b` and `M-f` (one word).

10. Type `M-x column <TAB> <RET>` (that's `ALT` + `column` + `Tab-key` +
    `Enter`). The command completes to `M-x column-number-mode`. In the
    mode line, you will now see both row and column number of the
    cursor position.

11. This last command "toggles", which means that you can switch it
    on/off by repeating the command. Try that a couple of times.


<a id="org16824b6"></a>

# Indentation, lines, paragraphs, undo

1.  To distribute the text over more than one line, enter `M-q`, or `M-x
       fill-paragraph`: this command will fill the text in lines of max 70
    characters).

2.  You can also toggle `M-x auto-fill-mode`, which will fill the
    paragraph any time you're at the of a line. You're told when a mode
    is enabled/disabled for the current buffer.

3.  Test that: go to the end of the current paragraph, enter a new
    (empty) line and insert the text from `text.txt` once again (`C-x i`).

4.  Enable `auto-fill-mode`, go to the end of the new line you just
    inserted, and press `<RET>`. The paragraph should be filled just so.

5.  You probably want to see this again! Type `C-x u` (or `C-/` or `C-_`) to
    undo the last operation, then press `<RET>` again. The minibuffer
    will report `Undo`.

6.  `C-x` commands can be repeated as often as you wish. For example, to
    go back 4 words, enter `C-u 4 M-b`.

7.  If you filled the lines, you should now have multiple lines. To go
    up and down them, use `C-p` (up/previous) and `C-n` (down/next). How
    would you go up 3 lines?  Right: `C-u 3 C-p`.

8.  Add the `text.txt` files another 5 times: navigate to the end of
    the text using `C-e` (end of line) and `C-n` (next line). Then 5 times:
    -   `<RET>` to create a new line
    -   `C-x i text.txt <RET>` to insert
    -   `C-e` to go to the end of the line
    -   Press `<RET>` to auto-fill paragraph

9.  To scroll one page down in this large file, use `C-v`. To scroll up,
    use `M-v`.

10. To go to the top of the file, enter `M-<`. To go to the end of the
    file, enter `M->`.

11. To recenter so that the line under the cursor is in the middle of
    the window, enter `C-l`.

12. Move around the file a little **without touching your mouse**:
    -   Jump to the top of the buffer (`M-<`)
    -   Go down one page (`C-v`)
    -   Go to column 35 jumping by words (`M-f`)
    -   Correct with character movements until you're at 35 (`C-f`, `C-b`)
    -   Jump to the end of the file (`M->`)
    -   Go up two pages (`M-v M-v`)
    -   Recenter (`C-l`)
    -   Go to the end of the line (`C-e`)
    -   Go back to the top of the buffer (`M-<`)

# Splitting windows

You can split windows any way you like.

1.  Split the window horizontally with `C-x 2`.

2.  Split the window you're in vertically with `C-x 3`.

3.  Move between windows with `C-x o` <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.

4.  Delete a window you're in with `C-x 0`

5.  Delete all but the current window with `C-x 1`.

6.  Recreate the following window setup:
    
    ![img](../img/0_windows.png)

7.  Delete all but the current window with `C-x 1`.


<a id="org086929c"></a>

# Delete, copy, kill/cut, yank/paste text

1.  You can delete the character under the cursor with `C-d`. Go ahead
    and delete some characters anywhere in the text.

2.  You can delete forward by toggling `M-x overwrite-mode`. Try that:
    press the space bar (`<SPC>`) a few times with and without overwrite
    mode. The modeline now shows `Ovwr`.

3.  Disable overwrite by running the function again: `M-x
       overwrite-mode`. There should now be **no** `Ovwr` in the mode line.

4.  Highlight a region: mark the beginning of the region with `C-SPC`
    (minibuffer: `Mark set`), and then move the cursor to wherever you
    want to end it:
    
    ![img](../img/0_region.png "Highlight region after setting mark with C-SPC")
5.  You can now run commands on the region, for example:
    -   delete it (`<Backdelete>`)
    -   cut ("kill") it (`C-w`)
    -   copy it (`M-w`)
    -   paste ("yank") it (`C-y`)

6.  To try this, mark a whole paragraph (beginning with `Lorem` and
    ending with `laborum`) and cut it (`C-w`).

7.  Move to the end of the buffer (`M->`), enter a new line (`<RET>`) and
    yank the region there (`C-y`).

8.  Mark another paragraph and copy (`M-w`) it, then go to to the top of
    the buffer (`M-<`) and yank it (`C-y`).

9.  If you prefer to use the Windows key bindings (cut = `C-x`, copy =
    `C-c` and paste = `C-v`) you can toggle them with `M-x cua-mode`.

10. However, `cua-mode` bindings will only be active when the mark is
    active, that is when a mark has been set or a region selected.


<a id="orgf33c8d4"></a>

# Searching up and down

1.  Emacs supports "incremental" search: start it with `C-s` followed by
    the search term:
    
    ![img](../img/0_search.png "Incremental search with C-s")

2.  Search for `l`, and then add `o` for `lo`, `<backdelete>` (‚Üê) and change it
    to `lu`, then `<backdelete>` again and change it to `labor`. Repeat `C-s`
    to move through the found instances.

3.  To end the search and get back where you started: `C-g` (quit). To
    stay where you found an instance: `C-f`.

4.  Search for `labor` again and keep going until the search wraps around
    the end of the buffer and goes back to the top.

5.  Search backwards in the same manner with `C-r`. The minibuffer will
    tell you what kind of search you've got going, e.g. `Overwrapped
       I-search backward` when you incrementally searched past the buffer
    with `C-r`.

6.  Stop the search (`C-g`) and start it again: if you do not enter a
    search term but just type `C-s` or `C-r` again, the last search term
    will appear.

7.  Stop the search with `C-g`.


<a id="orgbe76fab"></a>

# Directory and listing buffer

1.  Remove all windows but one with `C-x 1`.

2.  List the current directory with `C-x d` - this opens a new `Dired`
    ("Directory editor") buffer, which is very powerful.

3.  `Dired` has a bunch of single letter commands. One is `s` to sort the
    files by *name* or by *time* (shown in mode line): Go to the top of the
    buffer (`M-<`), then toggle this by pressing `s` twice.

4.  In the directory list, `.` stands for the current directory (the name
    of which appears at the top), and `..` stands for the next upper
    level directory.

5.  Go to the `..` line and press `<RET>` - this will get you to the
    directory above your own. Find `Downloads`, go to that line with the
    cursor and press `<RET>` to get back to where you came from.

6.  When the cursor is on the line for that file or directory, you can:
    -   rename it with `R`
    -   copy it with `C` (upper case)
    -   compress it (zip it) with `c` (lower case)
    -   mark it for some other command with `m`

7.  Split the screen horizontally, and in one of the two screens show
    the directory one level up:
    
    ![img](../img/dired.png "C-x 2 splits horizontally to show 2 Dired buffers")

8.  In the `Downloads` directory, find `text.txt` and copy it to the other
    directory:
    -   Go with the cursor to the file `text.txt` and type (upper case) `C`
    -   In the minibuffer, delete `Downloads/` , then `<RET>`
    -   The copy of the file appears in the other buffer

9.  Now, you already have several buffers open, including the file
    `tutor.txt`, a `Dired` buffer, and others: display all open buffers in a
    separate window with `C-x C-b`.
    
    ![img](../img/0_bufferlist.png "C-x C-b opens the **Buffer List** in a separate buffer")

10. Change to the `*Buffer List*` window with `C-x o`. Move the cursor on
    the line with `*scratch*` and press `<RET>` to open the `*scratch*`
    buffer.

11. Now enter `C-x b` and you see the message `Switch to buffer (default
        *Buffer List*):` in the mini-buffer. If you press `<RET>`, you get back
    to the `*Buffer List*`.

12. Enter `C-x b` again, but this time type `M-p` when the cursor is in the
    mini-buffer: the buffer you were in before that (the `Dired` buffer)
    is suggested. With `M-p` you can get to previous, with `M-n` to the
    next default until the list is at an end.

13. Using `C-x b`, return to the `tutor.txt` buffer and delete all other
    windows with `C-x 1`.

# Open shell, write, export, time stamp file

To close, there are a few special environments worth noting - you'll
be using them plenty later on:

1.  `M-x eshell` opens a Linux-style shell. In the shell, at the prompt
    `$`, enter `pwd` - the answer should be the location of your `tutor.txt`
    file. You can also compile files in this shell.

2.  Return to `tutor.txt`. Write the file to an Org-mode file `tutor.org`
    with `C-x C-w`: at the prompt in the minibuffer enter this name. The
    mode line will now list `tutor.org` and the mode `(Org)` instead of
    `tutor.txt` and the mode `(Text)`.
    
    ![img](../img/0_org.png "Modeline changes after writing the file as Org-file")

3.  Go to the top of the file (`M-<`), create an empty line and write
    into it: `* Headline` - the space between `*` and the text is
    important!

4.  Org-files can be exported in a variety of file formats: `HTML`,
    `LaTeX`, `ODT`, `text` and more. Enter `C-c C-e` to open the Org-file
    export dispatcher. When the prompt `Export command:` in the
    mini-buffer appears, enter `h o` - the text will be opened as an HTML
    file in your default browser:
    
    ![img](../img/0_export.png "Top of Org-file dispatched as HTML with C-x C-e h o")

5.  Go back to `tutor.org` in Emacs. Remove all content from the file and
    save the empty file:
    -   Mark whole buffer with `C-x h`
    -   Delete with the `<backdelete>` key (‚Üê)
    -   Save file with `C-x C-s`

6.  Insert these lines at the top of the buffer:
    
        #+TITLE: Emacs Tutorial
        #+AUTHOR: YourName [PLEDGED]
        Time-stamp: <>

7.  Recall that **"Pledged"** means that you have actually completed the
    tutorial along the lines of the instructions and in good faith as
    laid out in the [Lyon College Honor Pledge](https://catalog.lyon.edu/the-lyon-college-honor-pledge).

8.  Insert a time stamp with the command `M-x time-stamp`:
    
    ![img](../img/tutorial.png "Inserting a time stamp in the Org-file with M-x time-stamp")

9.  Save the file with `C-x C-s` and submit it in Canvas.

# Getting help

1.  For the full tutorial experience, open the Emacs tutorial (link on
    start page, or `C-h t`). In class, we're going to start your home
    assignment with a self-made tutorial.

2.  There is also complete self-documentation in hypertext stored inside
    Emacs. To access this system, enter `C-x i`. Info files expand into
    HTML files and are also [available on the Web](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html).

3.  Note: you can open any Web page in Emacs with `M-x eww URL`.

4.  To get help on a key binding, use `C-h k` and type the key.

5.  To get help on a function, use `C-h f` and enter the function.

6.  To get fuzzy help on anything, use `C-h a` followed by the term.

7.  For psychological help, try `M-x doctor`.


<a id="org0e2af44"></a>

# Looking up online help

1.  open the GNU Emacs home page in Emacs: `M-x eww RET` and give `gnu
       emacs` as the keyword.

2.  open the Google search page in EMacs: `M-x eww RET` followed by
    `google.com`.

3.  Look up the help for the undo command `C-/`.

4.  Look up the help for the `undo` function.

5.  Look up the help for `url` then open the browser on the URL (with `C-c
       C-o`): <https://tinyurl.com/3j5ddtuk>

me of Eliza in Emacs!


# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> There are packages that make window movement easier - e.g. I
use the `ace-window` package. You can install and update Emacs packages
with the package manager (`M-x package-list-packages`).

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> This operation refers to extracting source code from a code
block. The header command `:tangle yes` has to be set.
