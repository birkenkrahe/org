#+begin_notes
Converter boxes are used to connect two or more devices together which
otherwise couldn't be, due to differently shaped plugs, different
voltages, or different protocols of communication.

Converter boxes or converter cables are commonly found for several of
the plugs at the top of the list - such as from USB to micro-USB. As
this is supposed to be a Universal Converter Box, there are many
connections.

The humor from this comic comes from the sheer number of different
standards that all claim to be the universal way to connect two
devices, in their target market, as well as the progressively
ridiculous conversions that this box is capable of doing, for example,
converting audio from a 1/8 inch / 3.5 mm headphone jack, into a
variety of fuel suitable for running your car.

A connector is capable of making a connection to another connector
only if the connectors are of the same style and the opposite gender
("male" connector is plug, "female" connector is socket), except for
rare "genderless" connectors, such as the token ring mentioned
above. Gender changers are devices with two connectors of the same
gender. The "circular center pin DC adapter tips" in the title text
are barrel jack power plugs. There are a large number of these style
connectors, and many of these devices look the same, leading to
frustration.

#+begin_notes
Data science is concerned with getting data to work for us, to give us
its (presumed) hidden treasures. Data science has been called "the
sexiest job of the 21st century". Even if you don't want to become a
professonial data scientist, it's helpful to master the basic concepts
if you want to succeed in today's data-driven business. This course
focuses on data science basics, simple visualization and productivity
tools.

#+begin_notes
"Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming
language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more
robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun
to write than programs that are written only in a high-level
language. The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of
literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer. The
program is also viewed as a hypertext document, rather like the World
Wide Web." (Knuth, 1984)

#+begin_notes
"Here we take a simple boxplot of fuel consumption as a function of
cylinders and lets it transition between the number of gears available
in the cars. As this is a discrete split (gear being best described as
an ordered factor) we use transition_states and provides a relative
length to use for transition and state view. As not all combinations
of data is present there are states missing a box. We define that when
a box appears it should fade into view, whereas at should shrink away
when it disappear. Lastly we decide to use a sinusoidal easing for all
our aesthetics (here, only y is changing)."

*** Mathematical formulas


Org-mode recognizes $\LaTeX$. You can switch prettyprinting on with ~C-x
C-v \~ or add it to the ~#+Startup~ meta data as ~entitiespretty~.

$p \in [0,1]$

$x^n + y^n = z^n$

Binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$:
\[\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\]
