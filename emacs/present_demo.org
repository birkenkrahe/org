- Davies' "[[https://nostarch.com/bookofr][Book of R]]" is extensive (832p.)
- You don't have to read along but it might help
- Many other tutorials and textbooks available
- The best short online tutorial: [[https://github.com/matloff/fasteR][Matloff's "fasteR"]]
- Beware of ideologies (cp. Matloff's "[[http://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][TidyverseSceptic]]")
** Introduction to GNU Emacs + ESS + Org-mode
#+attr_html: :width 500px

- /Literate programming/ environment for 43 languages
- /IDE/ for R programming and /REPL/ for interactive coding

*** Literate programming
#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[../img/1_litprog.png]]

Source: "[[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wA7sb41EjV6GP3oBEFsOiYnoe29WILtLJR2sHSfr6Fs/edit?usp=sharing][Teaching data science with hacker tools]]" (2022)

- Common practice among data scientists
- /Paradigm/ behind interactive computing notebooks
- Useful when learning any programming language

*** R code blocks

#+begin_src R :exports both
  head(mtcars,2)
  library(MASS)
  sample <- function(x) { }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* Grading

** Home assignments

- There are 15 programming assignments altogether = 10 points each, or
  30% of your final grade.

- Register with DataCamp and complete the DataCamp chapter
  [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1420][Introduction to data scienceâ€‹]] by Monday, 22 August at 11 am (ca. 20
  min).

  + Data science definition
  + Data science workflow
  + Application to real-world problems
  + Different professional data science roles

- [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/assignments/1436][Complete the Emacs on-board tutorial]] and upload an edited copy to
  Canvas by Friday, 26 August at 11 am (ca. 60 min).

  + Get comfortable with Emacs keyboard bindings
  + Learn how to create, view, edit, save files
  + Learn how to insert a time stamp automatically
** Tests (not graded except final exam)
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/1_entry_quiz.png]]

- Tests have to be completed online, are timed, and have a deadline;
  after the deadline, you can play them an unlimited number of times
- There will be a revision quiz on Canvas every week, consisting of
  5-10 multiple choice, matching and true/false questions.
- A subset of the test questions will form the final exam (20% of your
  final grade) - we will practice in the last week before the exam.

** Practice - course infrastructure

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

    1) Open a browser
    2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/ds1 and /org)
    3) Open the command line terminal
    4) Open/close R
    5) Open Emacs
    6) Find the Emacs tutorial
    7) Open/close R inside Emacs
    8) Run R in an Org-mode file
    9) Close Emacs
    10) Close the command line terminal

*Note:* Class room practice completion = 10 points each for active
participation.

* Footnotes

[fn:1]CMS = Content Management System; these are the most common
systems in business applications - present whenever people create
'content' of any sort (documents e.g.) and need to store it for
later. CMS systems rely on database technology. In the case of Canvas,
that's MySQL.
