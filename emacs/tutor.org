* GNU Emacs
** Overview

   This short tutorial to guide you to your first steps with the GNU
   Emacs editor. You should also take time to complete the onboard
   tutorial. I will make a video of this tutorial, too.

   All ~PATH~ values assume that you work on a PC in Lyon 104[fn:1].

** Opening Emacs

   * If there's a Desktop shortcut, double-click on it to open Emacs
   * If there is no Destktop shortcut, open a terminal:

   #+begin_example
   Windows Search bar: CMD
   #+end_example     

   * In the terminal, enter this:

   #+begin_example
   C:\Program Files\GNU Emacs 27\x86_64\bin\emacs &
   #+end_example

   #+begin_quote
   Troubleshoot: check the location of the file ~emacs.exe~ using the
   File explorer, and correct the ~PATH~ accordingly.
   #+end_quote

   You should now see the Emacs startup screen:

* Footnotes

[fn:1]The ~PATH~ variable is the search path that the computer uses to
find a file. You can set it yourself on a computer where you have
administrative capabilities (such as your personal computer but not in
the lab).
