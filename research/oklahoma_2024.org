** A mighty fortress against the dangers of AI-assisted coding?

[[https://www.lyon.edu/marcus-birkenkrahe][Marcus Birkenkrahe, Lyon College]] - Invited talk at the
[[https://opensource.science/ossci-community-visits-kick-off-at-oklahoma-data-science-workshop-1ea0e25d08a0][Oklahoma Data Science Workshop]], March 22, 2024.

Literate programming, which combines code documentation with
explanatory text, enhances understanding, collaboration, and critical
thinking in data science, and has been popularized through tools like
Jupyter notebooks since Knuth introduced it in 1984. This talk will
discuss its integration into computer and data science education,
improving engagement, skills development, and computing
competence. Additionally, it will explore the interaction between AI
coding assistants and literate programming, highlighting how they can
mutually benefit teaching and learning by blending AI's automation
with human-centric documentation. Attendees will learn about the
synergy between these approaches and how to effectively combine them
for a richer educational experience.
