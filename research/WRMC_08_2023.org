[[https://www.lyon.edu/marcus-birkenkrahe][By Marcus Birkenkrahe, Associate Professor of Computer and Data
Science @Lyon College]] - invited talk @White River Medical Centre,
Batesville, August 8, 2023, 12 pm

** Abstract 1
#+begin_quote
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming medical
research and practice. These technologies are also creating new
opportunities for physicians to advance their academic publishing and
augment scholarly writing. This talk will provide an overview of
medical AI and its applications in healthcare. We will demystify key
concepts like machine learning, neural networks, and large language
models (LLMs). Drawing on examples of successful implementations and
pitfalls to avoid, we will demonstrate how resident physicians can
apply AI tools to improve literature reviews, streamline manuscript
drafting, ensure proper citation practices, and enhance overall
research productivity. Attendees will leave this session with a
clearer understanding of responsible AI use cases that can further
their publishing goals and career development. Interactive
demonstrations will showcase cutting-edge writing assistants and data
science platforms accessible to early-career clinicians and
researchers. The future of medical AI is bright, and learning how to
effectively leverage these emerging innovations will prepare residents
for leadership in modern data-driven medicine. [fn:1]

** Abstract 2
#+begin_quote
At the precipice of transformation, medicine stands, with emerging
technologies granting glimpses of a new horizon. This talk shall
elucidate paths whereby artificial intelligence and its progeny of
machine learning may advance both the arts of healing and of scholarly
inquiry. Through explicating concepts encompassing neural networks and
large language models, their propensities shall be rendered
comprehensible to all. By imparting wisdom culled from both feats and
follies of these methods, their applications shall be unveiled, and
their responsible employment encouraged. Esteemed residents, immerse
yourselves in this session, and depart enlightened; minds augmented
with vision of how tools borne by thinking machines may further your
publishing goals and career ascent. Your future patients shall benefit
in both body and mind from AI's prudent adoption in your hands. Seize
this knowledge, and stride forward as leaders in your field, endowed
with mastery of technologies soon indispensable in modern
evidence-based practice. [fn:2]
