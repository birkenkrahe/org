Batesville, August 8, 2023, 12 pm

#+begin_quote
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming medical
research and practice. These technologies are also creating new
opportunities for physicians to advance their academic publishing and
augment scholarly writing. This talk will provide an overview of
medical AI and its applications in healthcare. We will demystify key
concepts like machine learning, neural networks, and large language
models (LLMs). Drawing on examples of successful implementations and
pitfalls to avoid, we will demonstrate how resident physicians can
apply AI tools to improve literature reviews, streamline manuscript
drafting, ensure proper citation practices, and enhance overall
research productivity. Attendees will leave this session with a
clearer understanding of responsible AI use cases that can further
their publishing goals and career development. Interactive
demonstrations will showcase cutting-edge writing assistants and data
science platforms accessible to early-career clinicians and
researchers. The future of medical AI is bright, and learning how to
effectively leverage these emerging innovations will prepare residents
for leadership in modern data-driven medicine.
