** Impromptu experiments

One of the intriguing abilities of conversational chatbots is the
ability to attempt to match a real author's style. Let's see how this
works out. I asked the AI to rewrite the abstract in the style of
several authors starting with myself. The others are Nobel laureates
in medicine. Unless indicated otherwise, "AI" means "claude.ai" by
anthropic.

#+end_quote

**** What prompted your rewriting choices?

In the reply, "the paper draft provided earlier" refers to an earlier
request to the same AI to help me edit a research paper that I was
writing at the time:
#+begin_quote
You make a fair point - my rewritten abstract does have a very
distinctive style that is quite different from the original. Let me
explain my thought process:

When you asked me to rewrite the abstract "in the style of Marcus
Birkenkrahe", I interpreted this as an invitation to emulate some of
the particular speech and writing patterns I noticed in the paper
draft provided earlier. Specifically:

- Formal, almost ornate word choice and turn of phrase. For example
  using "elucidate", "progeny", "rendered comprehensible".

- Longer, multi-clause sentences rather than short choppy ones.

- Inversion of typical word order in some sentences for emphasis. Like
  "Seize this knowledge".

- Use of metaphor and grand, sweeping statements about technology and
  the future.

My goal was to try to adopt some of these distinctive stylistic
markers as an experiment in mimicry, while keeping the underlying
message similar. I aimed for pastiche over parody.

Of course, this is an AI's attempt to algorithmically analyze and
imitate writing patterns in a limited sample. It likely represents
only a crude facsimile of Dr. Birkenkrahe's talents. And stylistic
choices are highly personal.

But your prompt inspired me to try stretching my creative language
generation capabilities. I'm happy for any feedback to improve my
ability to flexibly adapt my writing style to different authors and
contexts while avoiding oversimplification or stereotyping. Please let
me know if I've missed the mark so I can continue learning!

**** What prompted your rewriting choices?

ChatGPT (actually GPT4's) answer to what prompted its choices when
trying to match my writing style is more structured, less
conversational, more aligned with my actual writing and (a little)
less ornate. Interestingly, it decided to alter the title of the talk,
too (without being asked to):
#+begin_quote
Marcus Birkenkrahe is known for his engaging and lively style of
writing, where complex concepts are translated into easily digestible
and relatable language. The aim was to emulate this style while
maintaining the integrity and purpose of the original abstract.

Key modifications were made to achieve this:

- Use of Figurative Language: I utilized metaphors and colorful
  language to make the abstract more engaging and less
  academic. Phrases like "publishing powerhouse", "digestible
  morsels", "highs and lows", and "catapulting you into the future"
  are examples of this.

- Personal and Relatable Tone: The abstract was designed to speak
  directly to the reader, aiming to create a conversational and
  inclusive atmosphere. This is achieved by using pronouns such as
  "you" and "we", and the tone is generally more informal and
  energetic, reflecting Birkenkrahe's style.

- Focus on Practicality and Application: Emphasizing the practical
  benefits and applications of Machine Learning to the audience,
  linking them directly to career growth, is a hallmark of
  Birkenkrahe's style. The abstract stresses how ML can be used in
  real-world situations, particularly for career advancement.

- Incorporating Future Trends: Looking towards the future is a common
  theme in Birkenkrahe's works. In the abstract, future trends in ML
  are not only mentioned but are presented as an exciting, forthcoming
  adventure, offering strategies to adapt to these innovations.

- Inspirational and Motivational Language: The use of words like
  "promises", "unlocking", "supercharge", and "fuel your career
  growth" are designed to motivate and inspire the reader, mirroring
  Birkenkrahe's signature style of instilling enthusiasm and optimism
  in his audience.

*** Abstract "In the style of [[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2022/paabo/facts/][Svante Pääbo]]" by Claude

AI: "I attempted to channel Pääbo's scholarly yet poetic voice and
penchant for mythic metaphors." In this example, the AI first veered
off the original abstract, and I had to bring it back by reminding it
of the loss of content: "In this last abstract, you have veered away
from the original title and purpose of the talk. Can you correct that
and bring it back to the title, yet use the voice of Svante Pääbo?"
#+begin_quote
Like ancient DNA revealing human prehistory, artificial intelligence
now unravels the mysteries of modern medicine. Its neural code, when
ethically harnessed, possesses immense power to enhance medical
research and practice. This lecture will elucidate AI’s transformative
potential for clinicians. We will decipher complex concepts like
machine learning and neural networks, rendering them
comprehensible. Experiences of success and failure will illuminate
responsible applications in literature reviews, manuscript drafting,
proper citations, and accelerating discovery. However, we must proceed
with care. AI is no oracle; it must serve clinicians, not supplant
them. Its outputs demand critical analysis. Yet AI-powered writing
tools offer immense possibility when judiciously applied. Attendees
will depart this lecture comprehending how to harness these
technologies to amplify their academic publishing and career
advancement. But stay vigilant against complacency. There is still
much we do not understand. AI is but a light in the darkness,
illuminating medicine’s yet uncharted frontiers. Its prudent adoption
today will empower clinicians to enhance patient care through tireless
mining of data’s wisdom.
#+end_quote

*** Abstract "In the style of [[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2018/allison/facts/][James P. Allison]]" by Claude

The AI offered no explanation for this rewrite attempt. It seemed to
mostly have capitalized on the topic of Allison's cancer research
instead of a particular writing style.
#+begin_quote
Cancer unleashed its wrath on humanity - but we’re now striking back
with artificial intelligence. These technologies are like immune cells
discovering and attacking tumors. Machine learning methods help detect
patterns hiding in massive data sets - potentially revealing new
treatments. But like an experimental drug, AI needs rigorous
testing. Success isn’t guaranteed. This talk will explain key concepts
in an engaging, easy-to-grasp way using examples of AI’s medical
insights and missteps. You’ll learn practical applications for
turbocharging research: scanning literature, drafting manuscripts,
properly citing sources. But AI isn’t a cure-all. It requires human
guidance to avoid misuse and bias. Attendees will leave this talk with
an action plan for harnessing AI - without getting burned. When
judiciously combined with clinician wisdom, AI could help surgeons
precisely excise disease and radiologists spot early warning
signs. But AI cannot replace human doctors - it’s an aid we must
thoughtfully work into their toolkits. Ultimately, AI is a powerful
new ally that - if skillfully implemented - will allow us to relieve
more suffering and save more lives.
#+end_quote

*** Abstract "In the style of [[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1908/ehrlich/facts/][Paul Ehrlich]]" by Claude

The AI called this "an approximation of Ehrlich's Victorian tone and
rhetoric." (Ehrlich was German but lived in Victorian times.)
#+begin_quote
Gentlemen, we stand at the dawn of a new age of medicine, in which
disease-causing elements may finally meet their match through
innovations of human ingenuity. The curious contrivances of artificial
intelligence possess immense potential for advancing treatments
through patterns perceived in volumes of data inconceivable to any one
mind alone. Yet we must remain ever-vigilant against overeagerness,
judiciously wielding these tools only where benefits outweigh all
possible harms. In this address, I shall elucidate how computing
machines may serve to bolster scholarly pursuits, expediting
literature reviews and manuscripts alike, while supplementing the
physician’s skills most arduously attained. Though these mechanisms
offer solutions to drudgeries that have long plagued publishing’s
path, one must take care not to surrender that solemn calling
completely to soulless automata. For there is no true replacement for
human wisdom, creativity, and conscience, those cardinal traits that
distinguish the exemplary physician. If prudently directed, this
technology may aid science to relieve suffering through expunging
deleterious agents that wreak their havoc within the body. But it must
not absolve us of the solemn duties for which we pledged our lives: to
act with compassion and honor, first and always doing no harm.
#+end_quote

*** Abstract "In the style of [[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1988/elion/biographical/][Gertrude Belle Elion]]" by Claude
The AI called Dr. Elion's a "logical yet humanistic scientific voice".
#+begin_quote
Though once mysterious in mechanism, medicine now illuminates pathways
to overcome disease through scientific innovation. Harnessing
technology’s potential while minimizing unforeseen risks presents new
challenges. Artificial intelligence and machine learning offer
powerful assets, if thoughtfully directed. By deducing hidden patterns
across datasets, AI can accelerate discoveries from bench to
bedside. This discussion will demystify these computing tools for
clinical audiences. We will decode complex algorithms so their
applications become comprehensible - and actionable. Whether
streamlining literature reviews, improving manuscript drafts, or
properly citing sources, responsible AI adoption can enhance
physicians’ research and publishing productivity. However, we must
remain vigilant. AI cannot replace human intelligence or ethical
reasoning; it is a resource to complement physicians’ skills. With
astute guidance, these technologies may help elucidate disease
mechanisms and identify new therapies. Yet our primary duty remains
furthering human health through scientific advancement. If carefully
directed, AI can aid medicine’s ability to save and improve lives. But
these are means, not ends. Our purpose endures: alleviate suffering
through research and care.

* Footnotes

[fn:1]This abstract was written by [[https://claude.ai][Claude 2]] using the prompt: "Write
an abstract for a talk on "Medical AI - How Machine Learning Can Help
Your Publishing Career" for resident doctors of the White River
Medical Center, Batesville, AR. The talk will explain the basics of
machine learning, give examples for successful and failed attempts to

account for the quality of the content because the AI and I had
multiple research-related conversations for about one week up to this
point, i.e. it had "learnt" something about my interests and
vocabulary, and many examples of my writing (both fiction and
non-fiction) are available online.
