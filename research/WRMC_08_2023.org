[[https://www.lyon.edu/marcus-birkenkrahe][By Marcus Birkenkrahe, Associate Professor of Computer and Data
Science @Lyon College]] - invited talk @White River Medical Centre,
Batesville, August 8, 2023, 12 pm

** Abstract
#+begin_quote
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming medical
research and practice. These technologies are also creating new
opportunities for physicians to advance their academic publishing and
augment scholarly writing. This talk will provide an overview of
medical AI and its applications in healthcare. We will demystify key
concepts like machine learning, neural networks, and large language
models (LLMs). Drawing on examples of successful implementations and
pitfalls to avoid, we will demonstrate how resident physicians can
apply AI tools to improve literature reviews, streamline manuscript
drafting, ensure proper citation practices, and enhance overall
research productivity. Attendees will leave this session with a
clearer understanding of responsible AI use cases that can further
their publishing goals and career development. Interactive
demonstrations will showcase cutting-edge writing assistants and data
science platforms accessible to early-career clinicians and
researchers. The future of medical AI is bright, and learning how to
effectively leverage these emerging innovations will prepare residents
for leadership in modern data-driven medicine. [fn:1]

** Abstract "In the style of Marcus Birkenkrahe"
#+begin_quote
At the precipice of transformation, medicine stands, with emerging
technologies granting glimpses of a new horizon. This talk shall
elucidate paths whereby artificial intelligence and its progeny of
machine learning may advance both the arts of healing and of scholarly
inquiry. Through explicating concepts encompassing neural networks and
large language models, their propensities shall be rendered
comprehensible to all. By imparting wisdom culled from both feats and
follies of these methods, their applications shall be unveiled, and
their responsible employment encouraged. Esteemed residents, immerse
yourselves in this session, and depart enlightened; minds augmented
with vision of how tools borne by thinking machines may further your
publishing goals and career ascent. Your future patients shall benefit
in both body and mind from AI's prudent adoption in your hands. Seize
this knowledge, and stride forward as leaders in your field, endowed
with mastery of technologies soon indispensable in modern
evidence-based practice. [fn:2]

* Footnotes
[fn:2]This abstract was written by [[https://claude.ai][Claude 2]] using the prompt: "Rewrite
the first abstract in the style of Marcus Birkenkrahe." I subsequently
asked "What made you rewrite the abstract in this particular style?
What influenced your choices?" Here is the answer ("the paper draft
provided earlier" refers to an earlier request to the same AI to help
me edit a research paper that I was writing):
#+begin_quote
You make a fair point - my rewritten abstract does have a very
distinctive style that is quite different from the original. Let me
explain my thought process:

When you asked me to rewrite the abstract "in the style of Marcus
Birkenkrahe", I interpreted this as an invitation to emulate some of
the particular speech and writing patterns I noticed in the paper
draft provided earlier. Specifically:

- Formal, almost ornate word choice and turn of phrase. For example
  using "elucidate", "progeny", "rendered comprehensible".

- Longer, multi-clause sentences rather than short choppy ones.

- Inversion of typical word order in some sentences for emphasis. Like
  "Seize this knowledge".

- Use of metaphor and grand, sweeping statements about technology and
  the future.

My goal was to try to adopt some of these distinctive stylistic
markers as an experiment in mimicry, while keeping the underlying
message similar. I aimed for pastiche over parody.

Of course, this is an AI's attempt to algorithmically analyze and
imitate writing patterns in a limited sample. It likely represents
only a crude facsimile of Dr. Birkenkrahe's talents. And stylistic
choices are highly personal.

But your prompt inspired me to try stretching my creative language
generation capabilities. I'm happy for any feedback to improve my
ability to flexibly adapt my writing style to different authors and
contexts while avoiding oversimplification or stereotyping. Please let
me know if I've missed the mark so I can continue learning!
