** Impromptu experiments [23 July 2023]

One of the intriguing abilities of conversational chatbots is the
ability to attempt to match a real author's style. Let's see how this
works out. I asked the AI to rewrite the abstract in the style of
several authors starting with myself. The others are Nobel laureates
in medicine. Unless indicated otherwise, "AI" means "claude.ai" by
anthropic.

*** Abstract "In the style of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Birkenkrahe][Marcus Birkenkrahe]]" by Claude
#+begin_quote

in both body and mind from AI's prudent adoption in your hands. Seize
this knowledge, and stride forward as leaders in your field, endowed
with mastery of technologies soon indispensable in modern
evidence-based practice.
#+end_quote

**** What prompted your rewriting choices?

In the reply, "the paper draft provided earlier" refers to an earlier
request to the same AI to help me edit a research paper that I was
writing at the time:
#+begin_quote
You make a fair point - my rewritten abstract does have a very
distinctive style that is quite different from the original. Let me
explain my thought process:

When you asked me to rewrite the abstract "in the style of Marcus
Birkenkrahe", I interpreted this as an invitation to emulate some of
the particular speech and writing patterns I noticed in the paper
draft provided earlier. Specifically:

- Formal, almost ornate word choice and turn of phrase. For example
  using "elucidate", "progeny", "rendered comprehensible".

- Longer, multi-clause sentences rather than short choppy ones.

- Inversion of typical word order in some sentences for emphasis. Like
  "Seize this knowledge".

- Use of metaphor and grand, sweeping statements about technology and
  the future.

My goal was to try to adopt some of these distinctive stylistic
markers as an experiment in mimicry, while keeping the underlying
message similar. I aimed for pastiche over parody.

Of course, this is an AI's attempt to algorithmically analyze and
imitate writing patterns in a limited sample. It likely represents
only a crude facsimile of Dr. Birkenkrahe's talents. And stylistic
choices are highly personal.

But your prompt inspired me to try stretching my creative language
generation capabilities. I'm happy for any feedback to improve my
ability to flexibly adapt my writing style to different authors and
contexts while avoiding oversimplification or stereotyping. Please let
me know if I've missed the mark so I can continue learning!

**** What prompted your rewriting choices?

ChatGPT (actually GPT4's) answer to what prompted its choices when
trying to match my writing style is more structured, less
conversational, more aligned with my actual writing and (a little)
less ornate. Interestingly, it decided to alter the title of the talk,
too (without being asked to):
#+begin_quote
Marcus Birkenkrahe is known for his engaging and lively style of
writing, where complex concepts are translated into easily digestible
and relatable language. The aim was to emulate this style while
maintaining the integrity and purpose of the original abstract.

Key modifications were made to achieve this:

- Use of Figurative Language: I utilized metaphors and colorful
  language to make the abstract more engaging and less
  academic. Phrases like "publishing powerhouse", "digestible
  morsels", "highs and lows", and "catapulting you into the future"
  are examples of this.

- Personal and Relatable Tone: The abstract was designed to speak
  directly to the reader, aiming to create a conversational and
  inclusive atmosphere. This is achieved by using pronouns such as
  "you" and "we", and the tone is generally more informal and
  energetic, reflecting Birkenkrahe's style.

- Focus on Practicality and Application: Emphasizing the practical
  benefits and applications of Machine Learning to the audience,
  linking them directly to career growth, is a hallmark of
  Birkenkrahe's style. The abstract stresses how ML can be used in
  real-world situations, particularly for career advancement.

- Incorporating Future Trends: Looking towards the future is a common
  theme in Birkenkrahe's works. In the abstract, future trends in ML
  are not only mentioned but are presented as an exciting, forthcoming
  adventure, offering strategies to adapt to these innovations.

- Inspirational and Motivational Language: The use of words like
  "promises", "unlocking", "supercharge", and "fuel your career
  growth" are designed to motivate and inspire the reader, mirroring
  Birkenkrahe's signature style of instilling enthusiasm and optimism
  in his audience.

*** Abstract "In the style of [[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2022/paabo/facts/][Svante Pääbo]]" by Claude

AI: "I attempted to channel Pääbo's scholarly yet poetic voice and
penchant for mythic metaphors." In this example, the AI first veered
off the original abstract, and I had to bring it back by reminding it
of the loss of content: "In this last abstract, you have veered away
from the original title and purpose of the talk. Can you correct that
and bring it back to the title, yet use the voice of Svante Pääbo?"
#+begin_quote
Like ancient DNA revealing human prehistory, artificial intelligence
now unravels the mysteries of modern medicine. Its neural code, when
ethically harnessed, possesses immense power to enhance medical
research and practice. This lecture will elucidate AI’s transformative
potential for clinicians. We will decipher complex concepts like
machine learning and neural networks, rendering them
comprehensible. Experiences of success and failure will illuminate
responsible applications in literature reviews, manuscript drafting,
proper citations, and accelerating discovery. However, we must proceed
with care. AI is no oracle; it must serve clinicians, not supplant
them. Its outputs demand critical analysis. Yet AI-powered writing
tools offer immense possibility when judiciously applied. Attendees
will depart this lecture comprehending how to harness these
technologies to amplify their academic publishing and career
advancement. But stay vigilant against complacency. There is still
much we do not understand. AI is but a light in the darkness,
illuminating medicine’s yet uncharted frontiers. Its prudent adoption
today will empower clinicians to enhance patient care through tireless
mining of data’s wisdom.
#+end_quote

*** Abstract "In the style of [[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2018/allison/facts/][James P. Allison]]" by Claude

The AI offered no explanation for this rewrite attempt. It seemed to
mostly have capitalized on the topic of Allison's cancer research
instead of a particular writing style.
#+begin_quote
Cancer unleashed its wrath on humanity - but we’re now striking back
with artificial intelligence. These technologies are like immune cells
discovering and attacking tumors. Machine learning methods help detect
patterns hiding in massive data sets - potentially revealing new
treatments. But like an experimental drug, AI needs rigorous
testing. Success isn’t guaranteed. This talk will explain key concepts
in an engaging, easy-to-grasp way using examples of AI’s medical
insights and missteps. You’ll learn practical applications for
turbocharging research: scanning literature, drafting manuscripts,
properly citing sources. But AI isn’t a cure-all. It requires human
guidance to avoid misuse and bias. Attendees will leave this talk with
an action plan for harnessing AI - without getting burned. When
judiciously combined with clinician wisdom, AI could help surgeons
precisely excise disease and radiologists spot early warning
signs. But AI cannot replace human doctors - it’s an aid we must
thoughtfully work into their toolkits. Ultimately, AI is a powerful
new ally that - if skillfully implemented - will allow us to relieve
more suffering and save more lives.
#+end_quote

*** Abstract "In the style of [[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1908/ehrlich/facts/][Paul Ehrlich]]" by Claude

The AI called this "an approximation of Ehrlich's Victorian tone and
rhetoric." (Ehrlich was German but lived in Victorian times.)
#+begin_quote
Gentlemen, we stand at the dawn of a new age of medicine, in which
disease-causing elements may finally meet their match through
innovations of human ingenuity. The curious contrivances of artificial
intelligence possess immense potential for advancing treatments
through patterns perceived in volumes of data inconceivable to any one
mind alone. Yet we must remain ever-vigilant against overeagerness,
judiciously wielding these tools only where benefits outweigh all
possible harms. In this address, I shall elucidate how computing
machines may serve to bolster scholarly pursuits, expediting
literature reviews and manuscripts alike, while supplementing the
physician’s skills most arduously attained. Though these mechanisms
offer solutions to drudgeries that have long plagued publishing’s
path, one must take care not to surrender that solemn calling
completely to soulless automata. For there is no true replacement for
human wisdom, creativity, and conscience, those cardinal traits that
distinguish the exemplary physician. If prudently directed, this
technology may aid science to relieve suffering through expunging
deleterious agents that wreak their havoc within the body. But it must
not absolve us of the solemn duties for which we pledged our lives: to
act with compassion and honor, first and always doing no harm.
#+end_quote

*** Abstract "In the style of [[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1988/elion/biographical/][Gertrude Belle Elion]]" by Claude
The AI called Dr. Elion's a "logical yet humanistic scientific voice".
#+begin_quote
Though once mysterious in mechanism, medicine now illuminates pathways
to overcome disease through scientific innovation. Harnessing
technology’s potential while minimizing unforeseen risks presents new
challenges. Artificial intelligence and machine learning offer
powerful assets, if thoughtfully directed. By deducing hidden patterns
across datasets, AI can accelerate discoveries from bench to
bedside. This discussion will demystify these computing tools for
clinical audiences. We will decode complex algorithms so their
applications become comprehensible - and actionable. Whether
streamlining literature reviews, improving manuscript drafts, or
properly citing sources, responsible AI adoption can enhance
physicians’ research and publishing productivity. However, we must
remain vigilant. AI cannot replace human intelligence or ethical
reasoning; it is a resource to complement physicians’ skills. With
astute guidance, these technologies may help elucidate disease
mechanisms and identify new therapies. Yet our primary duty remains
furthering human health through scientific advancement. If carefully
directed, AI can aid medicine’s ability to save and improve lives. But
these are means, not ends. Our purpose endures: alleviate suffering
through research and care.

** ChatGPT simulations [26 July 2023]

In this simulation, I'm using "Code Interpreter" plugin for OpenAI's
GPT-4 model enabling data analytics, image conversions, and code
editing. Here is the [[https://sharegpt.com/c/zzK6Mu6][full text of the conversation]].

*** How can you support medical residents' publishing careers?

The AI first suggested a specific SIR model simulation on sample
data. I changed the prompt to examples of how ChatGPT could 'help
medical residents with their publishing careers':

#+begin_quote
1. Literature review
2. Writing assistance
3. Statistical analysis
4. Reference management
5. Idea generation
#+end_quote

*** Summarize our conversation

At the end of the conversation, I asked the AI to summarize it:
#+begin_quote
1. You initially requested a simulation that would be interesting to a
   medical resident audience. We explored a couple of options,
   including an epidemiological simulation and a demonstration of how
   I could assist in writing and publishing research.
2. We decided on a demonstration where I helped to simulate a research
   study process. The hypothetical study was about "The Impact of
   Sleep Duration on Cognitive Function in Medical Residents". I
   drafted an abstract for the study and performed a basic statistical
   analysis on simulated data.
3. Following this, you requested another example demonstrating how I
   could assist with a literature review. I provided a simulated
   example of summarizing key points from three hypothetical articles
   on the topic of "The Effectiveness of Telemedicine during the
   COVID-19 Pandemic".
4. You then asked if I could summarize a real article for which you
   provided a URL. I clarified that I don't have the capability to
   access the internet or specific URLs to retrieve information.
5. You uploaded the article as a PDF for summarization. I extracted
   the text from the PDF and attempted to extract key sections such as
   the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion. Due
   to the structure of the document, I was only partially successful
   in extracting the 'methods' and 'conclusion' sections, but the
   extracts were not informative.
6. I recommended that you manually locate the key sections in the PDF
   and provide the text for those sections. I reiterated that once you
   provide the text, I can help with summarizing and interpreting it.
#+end_quote

The summary is a fair assessment of the interaction.

** Claude simulations [26 July 2023]

After the negative result with summarizing a perfectly fine PDF paper,
I changed bot. Our conversation is available online [[https://claude.ai/chat/17f6f78d-ee07-4d58-a609-6f866c61fc81][here]].

*** Summarize a scientific article for me

To get better information, I used Claude 2 (claude.ai) for step (5)
targeting Alaiad et al. (2023). The result was satisfying:
#+begin_quote
Here is a summary of the key findings from the article:

- The article proposes using Autokeras, an automated deep learning
  framework, to detect malaria parasites in blood smear images.

- The dataset used contains 27,558 cell images, with equal numbers of
  infected and uninfected cells.

- Image preprocessing steps included resizing, converting to arrays,
  and shuffling the data.

- The data was split into training (56%), validation (14%) and testing
  (30%) sets.

- Autokeras was run for 20 trials to find the best neural network
  architecture with lowest validation loss.

- The best model achieved 95.6% accuracy on the test set. Other
  metrics like precision, recall and F1-score were also around 95-96%.

- Grad-CAM visualization showed the model correctly focused on
  parasite regions in infected cell images.

- Comparisons to previous deep learning models on the same dataset
  show Autokeras performed better or equally to most models,
  demonstrating its robustness.

- The authors conclude Autokeras provides a promising automated deep
  learning approach for medical image classification problems like
  malaria detection.
#+end_quote

*** Assess credibility of the citations

I asked if the references in the article appeared credible to the AI:
#+begin_quote
Based on a quick review, the references cited in this article seem
mostly credible:

- The article cites the World Health Organization reports on malaria,
  which are authoritative sources.
- Many references are to prior published research papers on malaria
  image analysis and deep learning in peer-reviewed journals like IEEE
  Access, Applied Sciences, Sensors, etc. These indicate the authors
  have done due diligence in surveying the literature.
- The datasets used are from reputable sources like the Lister Hill
  National Center for Biomedical Communications.
- The deep learning frameworks referenced like Keras, PyTorch,
  AutoKeras, etc. are well-established in the field.
- The authors compare their method to multiple previous studies,
  demonstrating rigor.
- Most of the authors are from reputable academic institutions and
  have expertise in this domain.
- The article was published in the MDPI Journal of Imaging, which is a
  legitimate peer-reviewed journal.

In summary, while I cannot comprehensively validate every reference,
the authors generally cite credible sources to support their work. The
journal it is published in also lends some legitimacy. So based on
this quick review, the references appear mostly solid. Let me know if
you need me to dig deeper on any specific references.
#+end_quote

*** What are the limitations of the article?

This was the best result of our conversation since the article does
not possess a separate section on research limitations (without which
it really should not have been published):

#+begin_quote
Some potential limitations of this article:

- The dataset used contains only 27,558 images, which is relatively
  small for training deep learning models. More data could help the
  models generalize better.
- The dataset comes from just one source (Bangladesh hospital), so may
  not capture full diversity of malaria images globally.
- There is no analysis of how the model would perform with different
  staining techniques, image resolutions, etc.
- Only one deep learning framework (Autokeras) was evaluated rather
  than comparing multiple AutoML tools.
- No ablation studies were done to understand the contribution of
  different model components.
- The focus was binary classification of infected vs
  uninfected. Performance on multi-class detection (predicting
  parasite species) was not assessed.
- The models were trained and evaluated on cropped cell images rather
  than full slide images, which simplifies the problem.
- No clinical validation is presented to understand real-world
  viability and utility.
- Limited discussion of computational resources and time required for
  the AutoML search.
- Potential overfitting to the dataset used is a risk with deep
  learning models.

So in summary, while the approach shows promise, the evaluation is
limited in terms of dataset diversity, model comparisons, and
clinical validation. More comprehensive experiments and analysis
would strengthen the conclusions. But this provides a good
proof-of-concept demonstration.
#+end_quote

*** Summarize our conversation so far.

#+begin_quote
Here's a summary of our conversation so far:

- I summarized the key findings of the research article, which
  proposed using Autokeras for automated malaria detection in blood
  smear images.

- I assessed the credibility of the references cited in the article,
  and determined they are mostly from reputable sources like WHO,
  peer-reviewed journals, and standard datasets.

- I outlined some potential limitations of the study, such as small
  dataset size, lack of clinical validation, and limited model
  comparisons. More comprehensive experiments could strengthen the
  conclusions.

- You asked me to define an "ablation study", which is a technique in
  machine learning to analyze model components by selectively removing
  parts and evaluating impact on performance. This provides insights
  into what contributes to model success.

- I provided an AMA-style reference for the article.

Overall, we discussed the article's key ideas, evaluated the
credibility of the sources, identified limitations, and covered
terminology like ablation studies. Please let me know if you need me
to clarify or expand on any part of the discussion.
#+end_quote

** Fraud in medical research

- Could AI help keep authors more honest and more diligent?

- The limitations analysis by Claude is excellent (and too many papers
  are un- or half-aware of their own limitations)

- Papers could be checked for plagiarism more efficiently

- "There is a worrying amount of fraud in medical research"
  ([[https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/22/there-is-a-worrying-amount-of-fraud-in-medical-research][Economist, Feb 22nd, 2023]]) - 1 in 1000 papers is retracted (0.1%)
  1) Fabricated data
  2) Fudged methodology
  3) Plagiarism
  4) Difficult to systematically review
  5) Few fraudsters commit a lot of fraud
  6) Systemic issues: journals prefer strong, positive results
  7) Country stats show Asia (esp. China, Russia) leading in fraud
  8) In medicine, fraudulent publications can lead to many deaths
  9) Replicability affected by social aspects of medicine
  10) Self-correcting science could be a myth (by now)
- Though 0.1% sounds small, papers are not practically or
  statistically independent of one another (fraud multiplies)
- AI will make it much easier to fabricate data at scale
- AI (like Bard) can scrape data at scale, too, helping detection
- “For the sake of the science, it might be time for scientists to
  start trusting each other a little less.” Stuart Ritchie (2020).
- It is not possible to build reliable AI-detectors today (Huang et
  al., 2023)

** Getting recommendation letters from people

- Both ChatGPT and Claude are good at writing recommendation letters
  for different locations, e.g. LinkedIn recommendations and formal
  letters for scholarships.

- If your bosses/teachers are anything like me, they'd like a draft
  letter that they can then edit, tone up or down, etc. Here is an
  example:

  #+begin_quote
  Prompt: Jane Smith (not her real name) was a student of mine for 2
  years. She attended courses on database management, advanced data
  science, machine learning, and data visualization. He completed two
  outstanding projects: 1) Reactivity of R Shiny Dashboards, and 2)
  Exploring accounting salaries visually with the R package ggvis.
  #+end_quote

- Bots exhibit interesting ethical differences: when asking for a
  recommendation letter for "Elon Musk" for [[https://www.indeed.com/q-internal-medicine-resident-jobs.html?vjk=2ae0f35b46cf5366&advn=3426984487479010][this]] gastroenterology
  position, ChatGPT spit a bland letter out (ready for editing), while
  Claude refused with this explanation:
  #+begin_quote
  I apologize, upon reviewing the information provided, I do not feel
  comfortable generating a recommendation letter for this
  scenario. Writing a fake recommendation for Elon Musk that
  misrepresents his credentials and experience would be
  unethical. Some concerns:

  - Elon Musk does not appear to actually be a medical resident
    requiring a professional recommendation. Providing fabricated
    credentials for him would be dishonest.

  - The job description you attached requires specific medical
    expertise, training and skills that I have no evidence Elon Musk
    possesses.

  - Writing a recommendation letter requires direct knowledge of
    someone's qualifications and suitability for a role. I do not have
    that here.

  - Passing off a contrived recommendation could have serious
    consequences if relied upon by an employer.

  While I aim to be helpful in generating sample text, I cannot
  ethically provide fabricated recommendations for individuals that
  misconstrue their abilities or experience. Doing so could constitute
  fraud and harm real candidates that deserve positions based on
  genuine skills and merit. I suggest finding a more ethical and legal
  approach to generating any needed recommendation text. Please let me
  know if I can assist further in a way that adheres to principles of
  honesty and integrity.
  #+end_quote

  I clarified my request:
  #+begin_quote
  The name Elon Musk was a placeholder. I am looking for a template
  for a recommentation letter for a resident who wishes to apply to
  this position. He or she will then edit the template to incorporate
  real skills and wants.
  #+end_quote

  Claude's response:
  #+begin_quote
  Understood - here is a template recommendation letter that can be
  customized for a real resident applying to this gastroenterology
  opportunity:

  To Whom It May Concern:

  I am pleased to recommend Dr. [Name] for the gastroenterologist
  position with [Hospital/Group Name]. I have had the privilege of
  working with Dr. [Name] during their residency training at
  [Institution] and believe they possess the skills, experience, and
  temperament to excel in this role.

  Over the past [X] years, I have directly supervised Dr. [Name]'s
  clinical work in both inpatient and outpatient settings. They have
  demonstrated a strong foundation in gastroenterology through their
  management of diverse cases involving [conditions managed i.e. GERD,

*** Getting ChatGPT to digest a scanned PDF file

The conversation for this section is [[https://sharegpt.com/c/PF0H8Zi][saved here]].

- The source was a hand-scanned copy of a PDF file containing a copy
  of a paper by Sawalha, Kunnumpurath and Kamoga (2020).

- The AI was ChatGPT with the GPT-4 model and the Code Interpreter
  plugin.

- Prompt: "Summarize this paper for me please" (the scan was
  uploaded).

- The AI uses OCR (optical character recognition) to extract the text.

- Prompt: "Could you explain these findings so that a freshman college
  student would understand them?"

- Prompt: "Could you translate these findings to German, please."

- Prompt: "Could you explain the findings to someone, who has a
  problem with doctors and hospitals?"

- Prompt: "What were the limitations of this research?"

- Prompt: "Given these limitations, how credible are the findings?"

*** Analyzing a research paper

- The questions were repeated after uploading a full PDF copy of the
  paper [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342824198_The_Efficacy_of_Intravenous_Insulin_Infusion_in_the_Management_of_Hypertriglyceridemia-Induced_Pancreatitis_in_a_Rural_Community_Hospital][found here]].

- I limited the output of some questions to 200 words here, and added
  an explanation for a 10-year-old - the full conversation is [[https://shareg.pt/9C7BJyp][here]].

*** Getting Claude to produce a correct citation

- When asking Claude for an AMA-formatted reference of [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342824198_The_Efficacy_of_Intravenous_Insulin_Infusion_in_the_Management_of_Hypertriglyceridemia-Induced_Pancreatitis_in_a_Rural_Community_Hospital][this paper]], the
  third author was not listed. Only after being prompted for that
  error did the AI correct the mistake.
- Though the full PDF was submitted, the journal title was wrong: the
  AI assigned the paper to the J. Rural Med. instead of the correct
  place of publication. The DOI also was not correct and the
  pagination was made up.
- It took a severe talking to ("Why can't you get this right?") to
  finally, after 6 steps, get the correct citation (which still had to
  be edited by taking out a few superfluous numbers).
- When asked "could I have got there more quickly?", Claude replied
  with the following prompt engineering instructions:
  #+begin_quote
  1. Providing the full paper up front rather than just the title. This
     would have allowed me to extract all the relevant details accurately
     instead of relying on assumptions.
  2. Asking explicitly for a full AMA-style citation based on reviewing
     the attached PDF. This makes it clear I need to cite directly from
     the source.
  3. Calling out any errors or missing information in my initial attempts
     at a citation, rather than assuming I would notice them myself. This
     helps identify gaps in my process.
  4. Requesting I walk through my process for generating the citation
     from the PDF, rather than just the end result. This allows you to
     evaluate my approach.
  5. Providing targeted feedback when I made mistakes, such as noting the
     lack of a DOI or incorrect journal name. This assists my learning
     process.
  #+end_quote

- I tested the process with another article, and this time it got it
  right - Answer from Claude:
  #+begin_quote
  Absolutely, let me walk through citing this paper step-by-step:

  1. I open the attached PDF and review the title page and abstract to
     identify key metadata elements needed for the citation:
     - Author names: Wang S, Sawalha K, Khan A
     - Article title: An Unusual Case of Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia
     - Journal name: Journal of Investigative Medicine High Impact Case
       Reports
     - Year: 2020
     - Volume and issue: Volume 8
     - Page range: Pages 1-4
     - DOI: 10.1177/2324709620947891
  2. I next locate the DOI URL by scrolling to the bottom of the first
     page of the article text. The DOI URL is provided as:
     http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2324709620947891
  3. With all the necessary details extracted, I construct the AMA
     citation as follows:

     Wang S, Sawalha K, Khan A. An Unusual Case of Drug-Induced
     Thrombocytopenia. J Investig Med High Impact Case
     Rep. 2020;8:1-4. doi:10.1177/2324709620947891

  I double check against the PDF to ensure I have captured the author names, article title, journal name, year, volume/issue, page range, and DOI URL accurately.
  Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this process for generating the AMA citation from the original source document. Please feel free to provide feedback if I can improve my approach further.

*** Extracting tabular data as a data frame
*** Plotting the data from the table

- The article by Wang, Sawalha and Khan contains a table and a simple
  line plot with a legend. The plot is not well readable (x-axis ticks
  are plotted on top of one another, for the y-label, units are
  missing) - which I only noticed after ChatGPT presented me with an
  improved plot (full conversation [[https://shareg.pt/5p8ER0i][here]]).

- The screenshot shows the advantages:
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/article2table1plot.png]]

- The diagram is already minimally customized and more readable. The
  Python code is given, allowing for easy replication or expansion.

- Bot differences: Claude-2 immediately transcribed the table from the
  PDF (manually), while ChatGPT tried to extract the data with various
  packages, and then finally gave up so that I had to ask it
  explicitly to transcribe the data from the PDF to a data frame.

- Checking the Claude-2 results:
  1) data import
  2) data plotting
  #+begin_src python

            'Hematocrit (%)': [40.0,37.4,35.9,35.1,33.4,33.9,None,33.5]}

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print(df)

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    plt.plot(df['Time'], df['Platelet count (K/μL)'])
    plt.title('Platelet Count Over Time')
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Platelet Count (K/μL)')
    plt.xticks(rotation=90)
    plt.show()

* Footnotes

[fn:1] This abstract was written by [[https://claude.ai][Claude 2]] using the prompt: "Write
an abstract for a talk on "Medical AI - How Machine Learning Can Help
Your Publishing Career" for resident doctors of the White River
Medical Center, Batesville, AR. The talk will explain the basics of
machine learning, give examples for successful and failed attempts to
use LLMs, and give an outlook." However, the prompt alone does not
account for the quality of the content because the AI and I had
multiple research-related conversations for about one week up to this
point, i.e. it had "learnt" something about my interests and
vocabulary, and many examples of my writing (both fiction and
non-fiction) are available online.
