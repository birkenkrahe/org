** Abstract

(Created by ChatGPT based on the presentation slides).

"This presentation at the Annual Conference of the Arkansas College
Teachers of Business and Economics delves into the transformative role
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the realm of education. Drawing
upon the 2023 Stack Overflow survey, the presentation illuminates how
AI, particularly generative models, are becoming integral tools in
software development and coding education. While highlighting the
potential of AI in generating content and assisting in various
educational tasks, it also critically examines the limitations—such as
the inability to handle complexity and ethical considerations. Through
a blend of data-driven insights, real-world case studies, and personal
experiences, the talk offers a nuanced understanding of the emerging
synergy between AI and educational paradigms. The presentation is
richly illustrated with vintage comic book panels rendered in color
pencil sketch art, and it concludes by looking at the future
implications of AI in reshaping educational methodologies and skill
sets."
