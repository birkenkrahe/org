It is not appropriate or wise to put yourself as the first author
given your juniority and the role in the project as a hired
intern. Since you're Gen Z, I don't expect you to know this but such
is the real world: it's hierarchies. In 99% of the world's scientific
collaborations you wouldn't even be on the paper. I was only put on
the 1991 paper I mentioned because the lead scientist was a close
friend of my father's. In my other papers I was a PhD student who put
in 18-hour days over several years to be allowed in. These things have
not changed. On a strategic note: if you had followed the (default)
alphabetical order, any of us would have said "look, he did so much
work, and he's starting out, let him be the first!" By assuming
instead of putting yourself last and perhaps negotiating (based on
your position, which is weak), you abandoned this strategically strong
position. The truth is that if I wanted to write a conceptual paper
for a conference like this, and publish it, I'd do it in one evening,
and do the video once in 15 minutes (this is what I did in
spring). For a real experiment, our data are much too weak, and I'm
currently thinking that we should definitely not base our argument on
it. In fact, this may be more valuable as a comment on the meaning and
usefulness of synthetic data in an educational assessment context. In
any case, you're probably Catholic at least by name, and so you need
to accept your penance, which is that I will be the first author, and
you can be the second, Beal the third (the research was his and my
idea), and Yonts the fourth - provided they want to be on the paper at
all.

You cannot take for granted that you're in first position on a paper
where you are an intern working with senior researchers. I'll talk to
Drs. Beal and Yonts if they want to be part of the publication or not,
and then I'll let you know.

This study, conducted in the summer of 2024, aims at testing the
ability of generative AI to serve as an efficient non-expert grader
and feedback provider in the context of school-wide curriculum
assessment whereby non-expert educators would be asked to evaluate
student artefacts in a wide spectrum of disciplines at Undergraduate
level.

For the content, we used the conversational interface to OpenAI's
ChatGPT-4o to create diverse student personas and assignments based on
exam questions from two Undergraduate courses on religion and
philosophy[fn:3]. A total of 40 artifacts were created, 20 for each
question. A custom GPT model ("grader-GPT") was developed for grading
and providing feedback according to an existing rubric.

Three educators without specific expertise in the content area graded
and provided feedback on the synthetic artifacts using the same
rubrics as the grader-GPT. Both the educators and the grader-GPT
provided numerical grades and feedback in a specified format to ensure
consistency, and recorded the time required to grade each artifact.

The artifacts, along with their respective grades and feedback from
both the educators and the grader-GPT, were evaluated by a separate
group of educators using a questionnaire designed to assess the
accuracy and usefulness of the grades and the feedback.

Findings include the degree of alignment between the grades given by
the grader-GPT and the educators, a quality comparison, and potential
time savings. The benefits of this approach are weighed against the
potential drawbacks to enable a foundation for a possible integration
of generative AI in the assessment process.

Attendees of this presentation will gain insights into the practical
applications of generative AI in educational settings, specifically in
grading and feedback. They will learn about the methodology used in
creating and evaluating synthetic student artifacts, the effectiveness
of AI compared to human graders, and the potential benefits of AI
augmentation in curriculum assessment. Additionally, attendees will be
equipped with knowledge on implementing AI tools in their own
assessment processes, understanding both the advantages and
limitations, and how to achieve a balanced approach that leverages the
strengths of both AI and human oversight.

** Communication

*** From [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#starred/FMfcgzGxTNsdVbwJnpdkjfhksVfLfpMS][Wesley (May 16)]]

Following up on the chat that Marcus and I had on Tuesday with some
very brief notes for Nikki. Marcus and I discussed:

- pros-cons of an automated assessment process using AI
- logistics and feasibility of building such a program, including
  research/internship possibilities for a promising student and
  publication opportunities for the team
- how to judge the validity of the results from such a program

We left off, if I recall correctly, with the idea of considering a
pilot program: building out an AI assessment model for just one of the
rubrics of the core curriculum program and seeing how it works. To
take that a step further, I'm going to call a meeting during summer
between the three of us and Sarah White where the three of us can
speak more concretely about it and maybe hash out the frameworks of a
plan for the 24-25 AY. I'll also try to loop in Christian del Gobbo,
who Marcus thinks may be available to work for us in some kind of
internship arrangement.

*** [[https://chat.google.com/dm/-YPpAMAAAAE/sLJTFIEU9R4/sLJTFIEU9R4?cls=10][Suggestions to Cristian (Sun 19 May 2024)]]

1) Write your own brief based on what you have already heard and
   understood. This is something you can directly check with the
   client (who is represented by me for the time being).
2) You can send an email to Peter Staples and ask him if you could
   enroll in his project management course, which is fully online. I
   don't know if you have the prerequisites but the course will be
   useful for any future internship or in fact project and it will
   look good on your resume. Most of the work on the real world is
   organized alongside projects, which have to be managed, and even
   though it seems trivial, it's not trivial as soon as you're no
   longer alone doing the work.
3) start doing research using your own brief. You already know some of
   the basic parameters,and it is very likely that there is work
   already published along these lines (no perhaps not in assessment
   of student papers).
4) in parallel, imagine nobody had ever tried to solve this
   problem. How would you do it. Use Pólyas framework for problem
   solving both for the brief and for the research ([[https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Applied_Mathematics/Understanding_Elementary_Mathematics_(Harland)/10%3A_Problem_Solving_Logic_Packet/10.01%3A_George_Polya's_Four_Step_Problem_Solving_Process][source]]):
   1. Understand the problem:
      - Do you understand all the words?
      - Can you restate the problem in your own words?
      - Do you know what is given?
      - Do you know what the goal is?
      - Is there enough information?
      - Is there extraneous information?
      - Is this problem similar to another problem you have solved?
   2. Devise a plan - pick one or more strategies (an artful means to
      an end) to solve a problem:
      - Guess and test
      - Use a variable
      - Draw a picture
      - Look for a pattern
      - Make a list
      - Solve a simpler problem
      - Draw a diagram
      - Use direct reasoning
      - Solve an equivalent problem
      - Work backwards
      - Find use cases
      - Solve an equation
      - Look for a formula
      - Do a simulation
      - Use a model
   3. Carry out the plan: use IMRaD and review existing
      literature/sources [more on this later]
   4. Look back and reflect: test your results on humans / more
      literature review [more on this later]

5) start a log of the communications and conversations surrounding the
   problem and the internship. Both to communicate with clients and
   stakeholders (in this case, I am a stakeholder but the real client
   is the dean of assessment, and Professor Beal is another
   stakeholder).
6) building a nano model from scratch is one possible outcome of the
   feasibility study. Using the existing chat GPT API is the immediate
   goal.
7) even though you don't have a lot of experience in creating process
   diagrams, this is one example where creating a graphic for the
   workflows is probably very useful. To begin with, at some point you
   have to make a non-technical presentation and something like that
   is typically based on diagrams rather than text and formulas.
8) for future research build up a set of sources and assess their
   credibility and validity. The sources should not be a loose list
   but they should be sorted and classified, for example into
   scientific papers, conferences, blogs, and so on.
9) there are a lot of little side problems, for example report
   publishing in LaTeX, interfacing with different databases - both to
   pull data and to store data.
10) it is the end of the term and I am quite burned out and need a
    break, which is another reason, why my communication may be a
    little sluggish. Take a little time out to rest and let things
    settle in your brain.

    PS. I do not normally work on Sundays this is a one off!

*** [[https://chat.google.com/dm/-YPpAMAAAAE/75wVV4YtcUU/75wVV4YtcUU?cls=10][Project brief (draft, May 19)]]

The purpose of the project is to find out if AI can be used in this
way, as a third party to check student artifacts. The other professor
who is responsible for assessment, is unconvinced. She has not stated
her position yet. The purpose of the meeting later and summer is to
find out what she thinks. In my view the problem is of a more general
importance, this is just a potential use case, which may ultimately
fail. What that means, success of failure, needs to be ascertained
from the client: the question is how would an AI have to perform in
order to be accepted as a third party. But this is not the initial
problem for you to solve. I'm only telling you because there are a
lot of interesting questions behind it. In any case even starting
this project might result in a publishable paper, which we could
publish together sometime later this year. Results are publishable
even if the research fails, actually, if it fails it is often a lot
more interesting. We'll have to identify an hypothesis or more than
one. Hypothesis testing is one of the items you might have seen in
the DataCamp courses.

*** From Cristian - use of ChatGPT to structure project/paper ([[https://chat.google.com/dm/-YPpAMAAAAE/B43pwAQU7c8/B43pwAQU7c8?cls=10][24 May]])

Today I used ChatGPT to create a first draft of the project structure,
I gave it information and the idea of the structure that I had, and
this is the result. I mentioned that I wanted to do a blind evaluation
(Phase 3 and 4), I think that's a good idea, but I don't know if it's
completely aligned with the project's initial purpose. By the way,
this was not the first answer that ChatGPT gave me, I fine-tuned the
output a little bit. The second attachment concerns the possible
research paper structure (For the publication). Let me know what you
think.

*** To Cristian (25 May)

Hi there, I am not sure you should use ChatGPT for this particular
task - do you have first hand experience in the meta topic? (Project
management) Since I presume you don't, AI is going to give you
something very general, and an expert (i.e. me) will have to put all
the work in to teach you. A better approach is to do original
research, run into issues and make mistakes, try to fix them, ask
humans and, as a last resort, perhaps use AI (but really, as a
learner, don't because using AI is the same as "I don't really care
about this" - and I think you do). Now, of course, the damage is done:
it will be impossible for you to take a step back from what AI has to
say. You cannot undo this. Never, ever, ask AI for a solution unless
you either HATE the topic and just want to get it over with, or (like
in my case, when I use AI) can bring more than half a century of
experiences to bear - and are tired as a 60-year old is entitled to be
(at least at the end of term, at the start of the summer :-)

...but perhaps you can turn this early defeat into a triumph. Likely
not without putting a lot more time in than you'd have if you had
tried to do it all on your own - and now you'll have to share the
credit with the world, which (especially when young) is not to be
underestimated as a psychological burden. Btw, I wrote the project
brief without any AI (because I cared about the result for your sake).

[Shared my thoughts on the use of AI with Pietro because I am curious
what he thinks & he told me that you and he were talking tomorrow or
some time soon]

*** From Cristian ([[https://chat.google.com/dm/-YPpAMAAAAE/jdO9WOzbK0c/jdO9WOzbK0c?cls=10][May 26]])

My bad, I thought that using chatGPT for this kind of "organizational"
task was the right use of it. I wrote a raw structure by myself and
then gave it to ChatGPT to make it a much nicer look. But again, I
made a mistake due to my inexperience. Obviously, I can't erase all
the information the AI gave me, however, is good that I made this
mistake that early and that now I learned the lesson. So, let's take a
step back, as a first step in the project I wanted to create a project
structure to guide me (I don't know if this is right or wrong). Today
I'll write a project structure by myself, it may be similar to the one
created by the AI because essentially I gave him my general ideas to
create it, or let me know if you think I should do something else
before. I'm sorry (for myself first) about that, but I think it was
good that you stopped me and made me think when the project was not
even started. Thanks and let me know (I know that it's Sunday, so if
you want to answer me on Monday, no problem at all)

First of all, I should start by understanding the problem. In the
project brief, you stated that the purpose is to establish the
FEASIBILITY of using GAI. In my opinion, is pretty obvious that it's
possible to use GAI to asses student artifacts, but the question is
how they perform compared to a human expert such as a
professor. Therefore, always in my opinion, the core of the project
should be to make professors blindly rate answers from the GAI and
answers from Professors (Taking as example grades given during the
last semester, if it's possible and doesn't violate privacy) and then
with the collected data, see which entity performed better (GAI or
Professors). I think this is a more general approach and the
Hypothesis to test would be that professors still perform better than
GAI. From these results, we'd be able to state the pros and cons of
using GAI, and then evaluate in practice how this could be implemented
in Canvas for example. This is my first flux of thoughts, let me know
if I'm going out of scope and I didn't understand anything at all. Be
as direct as possible, I care about the content, not the form (In this
context, in other contexts I really care about the form). Thanks

*** To Cristian ([[https://chat.google.com/dm/-YPpAMAAAAE/p-eso4T3tIo/p-eso4T3tIo?cls=10][May 27]])
Pietro thought I'd been too harsh with you - but he's a young man and
they're soft :-) Seriously though, I applaud your initiative, I just
thought it necessary to impart my views - using AI very, very
sparingly in areas where you are already an expert (like bitcoin) is
good, anywhere else it is a dangerous game with your learning
progress. But I may be totally wrong - perhaps it works for you!

Review of [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bh2ff1QGW0hzEu-GHGn3eb4R4xlXRvVa/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=102963037093118135110&rtpof=true&sd=true][project plan]]: unsurprisingly, it is thorough, and the phase
structure seems good to me - you can totally use this plan to move
ahead. (I thought I'd have to do a lot of work on it but I was wrong.)
Of course I had ChatGPT check its own result, and unsurpringly it
thought "the project plan is comprehensive and well-thought-out,
addressing all necessary aspects for a successful study. Minor
improvements in documentation, risk management, and timeline
specificity could further enhance its effectiveness." Oh well.

Review of [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13XpHnNOuQYV5xZjXeM3usi5nWY30F5lo/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=102963037093118135110&rtpof=true&sd=true][paper structure]]: good as well. ChatGPT-4o thinks "Overall,
the proposed structure is comprehensive and well-organized, covering
all essential components of a research paper. Minor improvements in
clarity, documentation, and the inclusion of visual aids could further
enhance its effectiveness."

In principle, I think one can lift a paper straight from the project
documentation (or ask AI to create a draft doing this) - after reading
Mollick's article, you may understand that many past processes
surrounding research will have to be redesigned and rethought (they
already didn't work all that well - I've felt quite cynical about them
for a while - some areas of hard sciences like physics being an
exception.)

One major flaw in the AI's responses: there's no critique or even
reflection of the fact that you've been working with AI, and that AI
may be used - except in a generic way ("limitations due to GAI tools
used"), ignoring the special nature of these tools.

Answers to your specific questions/comments ([[https://chat.google.com/dm/-YPpAMAAAAE/gKqZ_IHSBrY/gKqZ_IHSBrY?cls=10][May 26]]):
#+begin_quote
 First of all, I should start by understanding the problem. In the
  project brief, you stated that the purpose is to establish the

#+end_quote

This is not obvious to me. "Feasibility" has many facets, and it's not
the same as "possible in principle" but also "at which price," where
"price" could be cost (money, time) for example because the process
could not be automated and therefore someone would have to be hired to
do it, or many people would have to be trained, or one would need a
consultant etc.

So, 'feasibility' relates to the whole software solution. There is,
however, no way for you (or me) to know all these aspects but the more
of them you can discover and at least list, the better for the
project's success.

You are addressing the issue of QUALITY, which is indeed the initial
focus.

#+begin_quote
The core of the project should be to make professors blindly rate
answers from the GAI and answers from Professors (Taking as example
grades given during the last semester, if it's possible and doesn't

#+end_quote
Sounds good but also sounds like something others have done (thought
of [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10052][this paper]] and this [[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4802463][2024 followup]]) but that wasn't it - it's about
using AI in the classroom: I'll be working through this paper over the
summer to implement the strategies in class). Data can always be
anonymized.

However, a quicker way to get some results will avoid gathering
primary data from professors (who are famously sluggish during the
summer) and instead create synthetic data (using AI) and simulate
actors.

You other thoughts about proceeding seem good to me.

#+begin_quote
 Be as direct as possible, I care about the content, not the form (In
 this context, in other contexts I really care about the form).
#+end_quote

In all worthwhile endeavours, especially those involving other people,
content and form are pretty indistinguishable...

My hunch, as I'm writing this is that automated grading with AI will
be way less important than conversation based augmentation and
interaction through tutoring. But that's not directly relevant to our
issue, and I may just be influenced by [[https://youtu.be/_nSmkyDNulk?si=mdth82touWHheJF0][this demo]] with Khan - founder
of khanacademy.org and his son.

Anything else you need from me right now? Otherwise I'll have to write
a book. You should upload the GAI generated drafts to the shared
drive, too.

** Call for participation to faculty (28 June)

For the second phase of our interdisciplinary research project on
AI-augmented assessment of student artefacts (with @Wesley Beal and
@Nikki Yonts), we need faculty volunteers who can spend 1-2 hours on:

1. Look at an AI prompt and the rubric of the artifact (2-3 page essay)
2. Read the artifact
3. Look at the grade and the feedback given on the artifact
4. Answer 6 Likert-scale questions in Google Forms

If you're interested, please reach out to me and I get you in touch
with our student researcher. Your benefits: improve your understanding
on how generative AI might affect grading, feedback, and assessment
before (almost) anyone else!

** Project brief (Draft 0.1 - May 23, 2024)
*** Title

"Automated Assessment of Artifacts using AI" (AAA-AI)

*** Purpose

- Establish the feasibility of using generative AI (GAI) to assess
  student artifacts across different study areas.

*** Objectives

Listed in the order in which these were discussed - which order makes
sense for the research workflow needs to be decided. All aspects are
subject to a literature (and source) review.

- List relevant pros and cons of an automated assessment process using
  GAI tools (in collaboration with faculty).

- Establish impact from using different GAIs.

- Identify logistic and infrastructure requirements (in collaboration
  with IT).

- Positive outcome: GAI can be used as an assessor for student artifacts
  with a given rubric.

- Negative outcome: GAI cannot be used as an assessor for student
  artifacts with a given rubric.

*** First prompt

1) reflect on religion in the context of your (philosophy of) life
2) discuss how 2 different religions (one not Abrahamic) have
   influenced your thoughts about your religious experience/philosophy

- Grade: 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 11
- Feedback: Prompt specifically asked for two religions but Stoicism
  is most definitely not a religion, which implies belief in a
  supernatural reality. Stoicism is an agnostic system of philosophy,
  and one might even argue that it is anti-theistic and, by
  implication, anti-Christian. The author has not understood the
  concept of religion. The reflection otherwise is very shallow and
  does not appear deeply felt.

- Grade: 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12
- Feedback: The concept of "agape" is interpreted very one-sided,
  because it includes also our love for God, not just God's
  unconditional love. Transcendentalism is not a religion though it is
  closely related to Unitarianism. The interpretation of perspectives
  is very naive (for example, Christianity flows from the idea of
  original sin, not solely from God's love, which is not selfless
  either). Finally, "Christianity" is not a monolithic viewpoint -
  there are many shades of Christianity. The reflection is shallow,
  and does not consider any shades of gray.

- Grade: 11 (1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2)
- Feedback: "Deep Ecology" is correctly identified as a philosophical
  perspective (though it is mostly described as a political point of
  view), and not as a religion. It complements Buddhism, which is a
  religion. The essay fails the main goal of contrasting
  religions. Otherwise, it is written in a very engaging way. What is
  personally missing for me is any mention of alternative viewpoints,
  which might have enriched the reflection (like a mirror, the
  reflection should contain beauty and ugliness if both are visible),
  and "activism" is usually in response to something missing necessary
  action.

- Grade: 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2)
- Feedback: Liberation Theology (LT) is a movement within Catholicism,
  so the rule of picking only one Abrahamic Faith was
  violated. Alternative viewpoints to the controversial LT (at least
  within the Catholic Church) are not discussed. Discussion is clear,
  but detail is missing - no real examples are provided. Little
  insight or thought especially given the origin of LT. What motivated
  the author to pursue "social justice" remains unclear.

- Grade: 22 (= 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 3)
- Feedback: Buddhism and Taoism are very closely related, and one
  might argue that they do not provide a profoundly different
  religious perspective - but I don't really know enough about
  either. The detail (esp. regarding physics) is pretty detailed and
  the reflection provides plenty of detail. What I'm missing is
  alternative viewpoints and/or sources, which are easy to come by
  (especially in physics where many main contributors were religious).

- Grade: 9 (= 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1)
- Feedback: Existentialism is not considered a religion but a
  philosophical movement (as the author himself writes). There are
  existentialist philosophers (like Kierkegaard) that are religious,
  and others (like Camus or Sartre) that are atheists or agnostics. I
  don't think Christianity (or existentialism) are adequately
  portrayed but rather there's some "cherry-picking" going on: the
  author takes from either what he believes helped him. The reflection
  misses out on all modern aspects of journalism related to both truth
  and the changed human existence in a digital world. Very little
  actual detail is given.

** Script

*** What is a programming language? ([[https://resources.github.com/software-development/what-is-a-programming-language/][GitHub]])

A programming language is a formal language to express instructions
for a computer. It is more like mathematical expressions than like
spoken languages.

*** How many languages are there?

- Spoken ("natural") languages: more than 7,000 - hard to say because
  we don't really know what language is ("Language is self-expression"
  defers the definition to "self"), where it comes from, or when a
  dialect is a new language (Source: [[https://www.worldatlas.com/society/how-many-languages-are-there-in-the-world.html][WorldAtlas]]).
  
- Programming ("formal") languages: there are more than 8,000
  historical programming languages but currently used about 700
  (Source: [[https://resources.github.com/software-development/what-is-a-programming-language/][GitHub]]).

*** What is a programming environment?

A programming environment is software that allows you to write and run
programs on a computer so that you get the same results when you apply
the same conditions.

The fundamental object of such an environment is the file - on today's
computers, everything is organized as a file. Therefore it's important
to understand how files are created, changed, moved around, and found.

At Lyon, in my computer and data science classes, I force students to
use Emacs, the "hacker's editor", to write and run code - this is
highly unusual since Emacs is supposed to have too steep a learning
curve for beginners (I don't think it does or if it does, it's worth
it - cp. Birkenkrahe, 2023).

*** What's the difference between Scratch and Python?

- What does it look like?
  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[./img/scratch.png]]

  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[./img/python.png]]

- Answer:  
  #+begin_quote
  *Scratch* is a high-level visual, block-based, script language:
  Scratch commands are organized as scripts which need to be run, and
  you don't have to know the precise form of commands because they're
  hardcoded as blocks. The programming is done in a script area, and
  the output is shown on a stage using "sprite" objects (like the
  cat). 

  *Python* is a high-level, interpreted/compiled programming language:
  you can run it in its interpreted form from a console, or you can
  run Python scripts (like Scratch scripts). It is used for teaching
  how to program but it is also used in professional settings. It is
  an important language for data science and machine learning.

  Both Scratch and Python are dynamically typed: the data type of
  variables is not declared or checked at compile time (when the
  executable program is created). It assigns values to variables and
  binds them to memory containers that can store any type of data.

  Both languages are considered easy to learn for beginners.

#+begin_quote
Good afternoon! We agreed last Tuesday that you'd establish a server
for up to 50 Linux VMs.

My preferred distro (because that's the one I use) is LinuxMint
(Debian, uses apt package mgr).

You asked for software for the template. This is what I'd need in class:
- GNU Emacs (v29) (I will provide the .emacs config)
- SQLite (sqlite3)
- Python 3 with pip
- R (r-base)

Everything else can be installed on the fly to local dirs. E.g. our
new colleague Dr. Dall'Olio might want Java for his intro course, but
I don't know which IDE he uses.

I'd be happy to help in any way I can, and I would test drive this

DEADLINE: <2024-05-31 Fri>

Email to Kurt:
#+begin_quote
Kurt - I have been invited by Taylor & Francis/CRC Press to write a
book on literate programming.

There hasn't been a book on this since 1992 and they think it could be
interesting especially because of AI, and because literate programming
is a central technique in data science. This has been an interest of
mine for, well, 30 years (I used it in my PhD thesis). However, I will
not be able, I think, to complete the book in the summer - it will
take me another summer (at least). But I would be able to make
substantial progress, and the grant would help me if I could use it to
travel and interview Donald Knuth (Stanford U) the inventor of
Literate Programming.

So what I'm asking is if you still want my proposal even though the
book won't be finished - I may be able to publish a paper this fall
depending on my progress, but the book is the target.
#+end_quote

** 1st draft

Dear committee members!

I completed the third-year tenure-track review in December, 2022.

*** Summary

The purpose of my research is to lay the groundwork for the
publication of a book on Literate Programming especially for computer
and data science education. The grant will be used to kickstart my
research and provide essential input by interviewing the creator of
the literate programming methodology, Stanford U. professor Donald
Knuth, and by creating an educator's toolkit for literate programming
using the Emacs text editor and the Org-mode package for Emacs, which
allows to write literate programs in 45 different programming
languages, and which will innovate and improve computer and data
science education at Lyon College.

*** Background

In January 2024, I was invited by CRC Press/Taylor and Francis Group
to write a book on "Literate Programming". [[https://taylorandfrancis.com/][Taylor & Francis Group]] is
an established London publisher of scientific textbooks since 1852,
and [[https://www.routledge.com/statistics/statistical-learning-data-mining][CRC Press/Routledge]] is a leading publisher in mathematics,
statistics and data science.

Literate programming, also known as interactive computing with digital
notebooks like Jupyter, RStudio or Google Colaboratory, is the
dominant practice in data science research, teaching and publication
(Kery et al., 2018). It is therefore surprising that the last (and
only) book on literate programming was published in 1992 by its
inventor, Donald Knuth, a Stanford U. computer scientist (Knuth,
1992). Software written with literate programming techniques include
the TeX and METAFONT programs. TeX, especially the macro package
LaTeX, is the prevalent typesetting system in many scientific
disciplines, including physics, mathematics, computer science, and
engineering, and are required by all top journals in these fields.

The rise of AI assistants especially in programming disciplines has
renewed the interest in literate programming as a methodology. In
2023, I published an article on literate programming in data science
education (Birkenkrahe, 2023), and in 2024 I published another one on
using literate programming to mitigate negative effects of AI-assisted
coding, and spoke at several conferences and workshops (Birkenkrahe,
2023a, 2023b, 2024a, 2024b). These articles seem to have captured the
interest of users, educators, and practitioners of data science, and
ultimately led to the offer by the publisher.

I am competent and motivated to write this book partly because I have
used literate programming in my graduate studies. The title of my
thesis (in theoretical particle physics) was: "Object-Oriented,
Literate Design of a Multigrid Toolkit for Lattice Gauge Theory
Simulations" (Speh, 1994) I have integrated the methodology into all
my classes at Lyon College.

*** Status

The next steps for this research projects are:
- Submitting a book proposal to the publisher (May 2024)
- Completing a literature review (June 2024)
- Interviewing Donald Knuth at Stanford U. (June/July 2024)
- Creating a literate programming educator's toolkit (June/July 2024)
- Piloting the toolkit in a dedicated computing environment
  (May-August 2024)

*** Budget

- Return flight Little Rock-San Francisco approx. $500.
- Accommodation for 2 nights approx. $200.
- Dedicated mid-range server for up to 50 students May-August 2024
  approx. 4 * $450 = $1,800

Total approx. $2,500.

*** Outcome

During the award period, the research will have the following outcomes:
- Data gathering (interview, literature review)
- Book proposal and possibly a sample chapter
- Conference presentation and paper or poster on book/toolkit
- Pilot for a literate programming toolkit

If successful, the toolkit will be used for teaching and learning in
all my computer and data science classes at Lyon. At present, I am
using the standard infrastructure which does not allow me to use Linux
but enforces the use of Windows without administrative rights for the
students[fn:1]. This severely limits the efficiency and range of their work.

* Linux server (Research grant)

** Letter to Miah (May)
Good morning Miah -

I hope you're well. My research grant has been approved and I am keen
to move on towards using the bulk of the funds for a dedicated
computer and data science Linux server that all students in my courses
can use from both the computer labs and from home if possible.

However, it may be that a dedicated server is not the best way to go
forward, and I rely on your expertise and infrastructure experience to
suggest a better solution if there is one.

There is $2,280 available from the grant for this project, because I
don't think I want to travel to CA for an interview after all. I'll
get the data some other way from Knuth.

Though the grant is originally targeting my literate programming book
project (attached), establishing an appropriate computing
infrastructure (dubbed "Literate Programming Toolkit" in the proposal)
is part of the experience that I want the students to have - literate
programming cannot happen in a vacuum (and should not rely on Windows
boxes).

Let me know if and when you want to discuss this. I am available
pretty much all the time to come out and meet you (haven't been in
your IT building yet!).

Cheers, Marcus

PS. Ideally, I want to use the server for my fall classes -
introductory data science (Python), data structures with C++, and data
visualization (Python) - all of them in connection with Emacs. My
personal switching costs are zero because I'm privately only using
Linux.

* DONE Summer Grant 2024
** Project Summary:

The essence of my proposed research is to establish the foundational
work necessary for publishing a book on Literate Programming,
specifically tailored to enhance computer and data science
education. This initiative will be catalyzed through the grant,
enabling me to commence my research and gather invaluable insights by
interviewing Professor [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth][Donald Knuth]] of Stanford University, the
progenitor of literate programming. Furthermore, I plan to develop an
educator's toolkit for literate programming. This toolkit, leveraging
the Emacs text editor and the Org-mode package, will support literate
programming in 45 different programming languages, thus offering an
innovative approach to bolstering computer and data science pedagogy
at Lyon College.

** Background and Justification:

In January 2024, I was honored with an invitation from [[https://www.routledge.com/statistics/statistical-learning-data-mining][CRC
Press]]/[[https://taylorandfrancis.com/][Taylor and Francis Group]], a prestigious London-based publisher
of scientific textbooks since 1852, to author a book on "Literate
Programming". This methodology, synonymous with interactive computing
through digital notebooks like Jupyter, RStudio, and Google
Colaboratory, remains a cornerstone in data science research,
teaching, and publication (Kery et al., 2018). Despite its ubiquity,
the literature on this subject has been scant since Donald Knuth's
seminal publication in 1992. My previous publications and conference
presentations in 2023 and 2024 have sparked a renewed interest in
literate programming, especially in the context of AI-assisted
programming. My unique position is further strengthened by my
practical experience with literate programming during my graduate
studies in theoretical particle physics (Speh, 1994), as well as its
integration into my courses at Lyon College (Birkenkrahe, 2023).

** Research Status and Next Steps:

The forthcoming phases of this research project include:
- Submission of a detailed book proposal to the publisher by May 2024.
- Completion of an extensive literature review by June 2024.
- An interview with Donald Knuth at Stanford University, scheduled for
  June/July 2024.
- Development and piloting of the literate programming educator's
  toolkit from May to August 2024.

** Budget Overview:

The financial blueprint for the project encompasses:
- A return flight from Little Rock to San Francisco at an estimated
  cost of $500.
- Accommodation for two nights, projected at $200.
- A dedicated mid-range server for student use from May to August
  2024, costing approximately $1,800[fn:2].
This culminates in a total budget requirement of roughly $2,500.

** Expected Outcomes:

The grant period is expected to yield the following results:
- Comprehensive data collection through interviews and literature
  reviews.
- A robust book proposal, potentially accompanied by a sample chapter.
- A conference presentation, along with a paper or poster detailing
  the book and toolkit.
- A pilot phase for the literate programming toolkit, enhancing our
  teaching and learning framework.

This project not only aims to bridge the current gap in literate
programming literature but also seeks to innovate the educational
tools available for computer and data science instruction at Lyon
College. Currently constrained by infrastructure that limits the use
of Linux and imposes Windows without administrative rights, this
initiative promises to significantly expand the computational
capabilities accessible to our students. This is a critical step
forward, considering my previous efforts to supplement our resources
with Raspberry Pi Linux boxes, which, while beneficial, fall short of
meeting the demands of more complex applications like big data and
machine learning.

*** Letter
David - I'd like to propose the creation of a cybersecurity with
Python certificate summer course. Below are some first thoughts.

I'd like to know from the division heads meeting if there is an
interest at Lyon to develop such an offering. I do know that there are
students and professional members of the community interested.

There is a wide variety of cybersecurity courses out there, most of
them as virtual online courses, and most of them do not seem to impart
the practical, in-depth skills that this course will offer - an
example is the new [[https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity][Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate]] - an
8 course series of ca. 137 hours duration with only basic information.

The summer course would be a pilot but it should already offer a Lyon
certificate. Since cybersecurity is a fast-changing field, there are
no definite accreditation or certificate standards (though of course
there are some very popular ones (like [[https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst][CompTIA]]).

This program is special because it brings together computer science,
industry knowledge, and data science.

My hope is that we might be able to put together a portfolio of
different certificates, ideally with more than one instructor per
certificate.

*** Cybersecurity with Python Lyon College Certificate

**** Schedule

The course would meet on 23 days (May 28-June 27) for 2 hours each
day. There would be 2 hours homework outside of class - in total,
this is the equivalent of 3 credit course (92 hours).

For the first time, the course should take care in the classroom at
Lyon, though a hybrid is possible (classroom + online attendees). To
attract a diverse group of students, it could take place during
lunchtime or evening hours.

No prerequisites except a general affinity to numbers and
computers. The programming language (Python) and the necessary maths
(graph theory, discrete maths, number theory, combinatorics) are
introduced and unpacked during the course.

**** Certificate

Successful course completion (> 60% of available points) would come
with a Lyon College Certificate "Cybersecurity with Python" that
lists major course components mastered:
1. Securing computer networks with Graph algorithms.
2. Analyzing and monitoring network traffic and packet data.
3. Identifying threats with Social Network Analysis.
4. Tracking people in space with digital information.
5. Cybersecurity capstone project.

**** Instructor

- Dr. Marcus Birkenkrahe has been a teacher of computer and data
  science and business informatics since 2007. Prior to teaching, he
  was head of competitive intelligence at Shell International, and
  head of knowledge management at Accenture. At Shell, he supervised
  globewide network penetration testing and participated in global
  scenario analysis. At Accenture, he helped to build an active threat
  simulator for professional IT consultants. He is associate editor of
  the International Journal of Data Science, and editorial board
  member of the International Journal of Big Data Management.

**** Draft syllabus

The draft syllabus can be adapted as per the learning pace of the
students:
- Each topic includes practical examples and exercises for better
  understanding.
- The course provides resources for further learning and
  exploration.
- The course includes discussions on cybersecurity ethics and
  responsible conduct throughout the course.
- Regular assessments, quizzes, and feedback are integrated to gauge
  the understanding and learning progress of the students.

spring 2024 at Lyon College ([[https://www.lyon.edu/religion-and-philosophy-courses][Catalog]]).

[fn:1]I used most of my research funds given to my by the college when
I first joined in 2021 to buy 20 Raspberry Pi Linux boxes that I use
in several classes but that do not satisfy the computational needs of
many interesting applications, for example for big data and machine
learning.

[fn:2]An alternative to renting a cloud-based server hosted outside of
Lyon is to purchase a dedicated server of our own. I am currently
checking this option with Lyon College IT services. If this proves
viable, the $1,800 would go back to Lyon College to purchase a
mid-level server whose cost would be in the same ballpark.
