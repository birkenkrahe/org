## Fibonacci Series in Python

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is
the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0
and 1. It's a classic example used in computer science and
programming. Below is a Python implementation to generate a
Fibonacci series up to a given number.

    def fibonacci(n):
        a, b = 0, 1
        while a < n:
            print(a, end=' ')
            a, b = b, a+b
            print("Fibonacci series up to 10:")
            fibonacci(10)

This Org-mode snippet includes a brief explanation of the Fibonacci
series, followed by a Python function fibonacci(n) which prints the
Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number n. The references provide
additional information on Python 3 and the Fibonacci sequence.

## Fibonacci Series in Python

The Fibonacci sequence is a significant concept in both mathematics
and computer science. It is a series where each number is the sum of
the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This simple
yet profound sequence finds its application in various fields,
including coding algorithms and theoretical studies.

### Process to Develop the Program

The development process began with understanding the mathematical
basis of the Fibonacci sequence. Recognizing its recursive nature
was crucial. However, for programming efficiency, an iterative
approach was chosen to avoid the potential stack overflow issues
associated with recursion in larger sequences. The Python language
was selected for its simplicity and readability.

### Python Code for Fibonacci Series

The following Python code demonstrates an efficient way to generate
the Fibonacci series up to a given number. It uses a while loop for
iteration and tuple unpacking for updating the series values.

    def fibonacci(n):
        a, b = 0, 1
        while a < n:
            print(a, end=' ')
            a, b = b, a+b
            print("Fibonacci series up to 10:")
            fibonacci(10)


<a id="org9630e04"></a>

### Explanation of the Code

The \`fibonacci\` function initializes two variables, \`a\` and \`b\`,
representing the first two numbers in the sequence. The while loop
continues as long as \`a\` is less than the input \`n\`. Inside the
loop, the current value of \`a\` is printed, and then \`a\` and \`b\` are
updated to the next two numbers in the sequence. This is done
efficiently using Python's tuple unpacking.
