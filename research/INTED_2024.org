Literate programming emphasizes the importance of clear code
documentation and explanatory text integration, and fosters a deeper
understanding of engineering concepts, effective collaboration, and
critical thinking skills. It has been at the forefront of data science
practice in the form of interactive notebooks like Jupyter notebooks
for over a decade. In fact, literate programming as a technique of
structured documentation has been used in computational physics and
engineering education and practice since its definition by Knuth
in 1984.

This presentation critically examines the role of AI coding assistants
and their impact on the relevance of literate programming in
engineering education. As AI coding assistants advance, offering
real-time feedback and automated code completion, questions arise
regarding the necessity of literate programming principles.

The session explores the benefits of AI coding assistants, including
enhanced coding efficiency and support for novice learners. However,
it also considers the potential drawbacks and limitations of relying
solely on these tools. We posit a symbiotic relationship between AI
coding assistants and literate programming: both approaches can
complement each other by combining AI automation with human-readable
documentation.

Attendees will gain a nuanced understanding of the interplay between
AI coding assistants and literate programming in data science and
engineering education. They will consider the strengths and
limitations of each approach and explore how to strike a balance to
create a comprehensive educational experience.
