**Speaker:** [Marcus Birkenkrahe, Associate Professor of Computer and Data
Science @Lyon College](https://www.lyon.edu/marcus-birkenkrahe) - invited talk @White River Medical Centre,
Batesville, August 8, 2023, 12 pm


## Abstract

> Artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming medical
> research and practice. These technologies are also creating new
> opportunities for physicians to advance their academic publishing and
> augment scholarly writing. This talk will provide an overview of
> medical AI and its applications in healthcare. We will demystify key
> concepts like machine learning, neural networks, and large language
> models (LLMs). Drawing on examples of successful implementations and
> pitfalls to avoid, we will demonstrate how resident physicians can
> apply AI tools to improve literature reviews, streamline manuscript
> drafting, ensure proper citation practices, and enhance overall
> research productivity. Attendees will leave this session with a
> clearer understanding of responsible AI use cases that can further
> their publishing goals and career development. Interactive
> demonstrations will showcase cutting-edge writing assistants and data
> science platforms accessible to early-career clinicians and
> researchers. The future of medical AI is bright, and learning how to
> effectively leverage these emerging innovations will prepare residents
> for leadership in modern data-driven medicine. <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> This abstract was written by [Claude 2](https://claude.ai) using the prompt: "Write
an abstract for a talk on "Medical AI - How Machine Learning Can Help
Your Publishing Career" for resident doctors of the White River
Medical Center, Batesville, AR. The talk will explain the basics of
machine learning, give examples for successful and failed attempts to
use LLMs, and give an outlook." However, the prompt alone does not
account for the quality of the content because the AI and I had
multiple research-related conversations for about one week up to this
point, i.e. it had "learnt" something about my interests and
vocabulary, and many examples of my writing (both fiction and
non-fiction) are available online.
