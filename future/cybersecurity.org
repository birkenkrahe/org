** Schedule

The course would meet on 23 days (May 28-June 27) for 2 hours each
day. There would be 2 hours homework outside of class - in total,
this is the equivalent of 3 credit course (92 hours).

For the first time, the course should take care in the classroom at
Lyon, though a hybrid is possible (classroom + online attendees). To
attract a diverse group of students, it could take place during
lunchtime or evening hours.

No prerequisites except a general affinity to numbers and
computers. The programming language (Python) and the necessary maths
(graph theory, discrete maths, number theory, combinatorics) are
introduced and unpacked during the course.

** Certificate

Successful course completion (> 60% of available points) would come
with a Lyon College Certificate "Cybersecurity with Python" that
lists major course components mastered:
1. Securing computer networks with Graph algorithms.
2. Analyzing and monitoring network traffic and packet data.
3. Identifying threats with Social Network Analysis.
4. Tracking people in space with digital information.
5. Cybersecurity capstone project.

** Instructor

- Dr. Marcus Birkenkrahe has been a teacher of computer and data
  science and business informatics since 2007. Prior to teaching, he
  was head of competitive intelligence at Shell International, and
  head of knowledge management at Accenture. At Shell, he supervised
  globewide network penetration testing and participated in global
  scenario analysis. At Accenture, he helped to build an active threat
  simulator for professional IT consultants. He is associate editor of
  the International Journal of Data Science, and editorial board
  member of the International Journal of Big Data Management.

** Draft syllabus

The draft syllabus can be adapted as per the learning pace of the
students:
- Each topic includes practical examples and exercises for better
  understanding.
- The course provides resources for further learning and
  exploration.
- The course includes discussions on cybersecurity ethics and
  responsible conduct throughout the course.
- Regular assessments, quizzes, and feedback are integrated to gauge
  the understanding and learning progress of the students.
