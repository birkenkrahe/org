* What's here?

  This repo contains `.org` files (Emacs Org-mode), and `.md` files
  (Markdown). The only visible difference is that the Markdown files
  have a TOC.

  To be up to date, you should fork this repo to your own GitHub space
  and fetch upstream when your repo is behind.

  These are FAQs for all my courses. Each course also carries a local
  FAQ file in the respective repo.

  These are irregular notes that I write on topics concerning all
  courses. Each course also has a wiki where I write course-specific
  content.
