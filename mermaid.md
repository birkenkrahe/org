mermaid is a JS extension to markdown, which allows you to create simple diagrams. It's kind of cool as an integration. Since Emacs and Org-mode are my mojo, I won't do much with this, but it's useful to know. 
[Here is more information](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/).

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```
