# Completing the GitHub "hello world" exercise

The [hello world practice exercise](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) is the first stop after
successfully creating a GitHub account. 

1.  Create a **repository**. Choose if you wish it to be `private` or
    `public`, and if you want to add a `README.md` file (which will
    be opened by default so it's the first thing a visitor will see).

2.  Create a branch
