* What is this?

  This is a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file for all my courses
  at Lyon College. For individual FAQs, see the resp. course repos.

* How should you read?
  There are different ways to read a demanding text. Since I
  systematize everything, let me try to systematize this for you,
  too - even though reading is quite a personal activity (involving,
  for example, taste), I believe that it is useful to have a system
  if your goal is to learn the most with the least effort[fn:1]. In
  the following, you can substitute "read" for "learn using media":
  instead of a printed book, you can also use a digital book, a
  podcast, or a video[fn:2]. I can think of (1) skimming; (2) shallow
  reading; (3) deep reading; (4) reading with notes; (5) reading with
  props; (6) re-reading. What are these about?

  1) *Skimming*: quickly go over the material in an intuitive fashion
     to decide what to do with it later, or to get at least a basic
     idea of what's being said. For scientific papers: read abstract,
     then (if still interesting) go to the conclusions at the end.

  2) *Shallow reading:* read through the whole text slowly, without
     too many breaks[fn:3], in order to get a general picture and
     already identify areas of information (to answer questions like:
     am I too ignorant to understand this? What do I already know? How
     long will it take me to fully unlock this text? Will it be worth
     it?).

  3) *Deep reading:* Deep reading implies not taking breaks and
     holding the tension of not understanding. The only break that I
     allow myself for this mode of reading is to take my eyes off the
     text to think. The point is not to break concentration, because
     if you want to summon your full forces of association, you need
     to immerse yourself in the material. Deep reading almost always
     leaves me hungry for the next reading stage (reading with notes),
     or for reading something else too, or instead (e.g. if the text
     was inspiring and interesting, but just too hard to understand
     without working through it in its entirety).

  4) *Reading with notes:* This mode and the next are the most
     time-intensive ones. I employ them whenever I am working out a
     lecture, or practice exercises, or if I find something really
     hard of I am puzzled or stumped[fn:4]. I find it important to
     write everything with long hand in a proper notebook (lined,
     21x31, softcover). I use a lovely fountain pen with black ink and
     a converter that I have to refill by hand). Writing in this
     notebook feels good and I like looking at my notes afterwards,
     which is important, even though most of these notes will never be
     looked at again: the point is not to duplicate the text but to
     get it into my head. I find that taking digital notes does not
     compare with analog notes. From all of this, you can discern that
     the way of taking notes is quite personal and cannot be part of
     the (universal) system. You may prefer to write with a pencil on
     individual sheets of yellow squared paper, or in a college block,
     or with a brush on hand-made Japanese paper. It doesn't matter.

     For example, here are two pages of "reading with notes" based on
     a series of four short videos in the Coursera course "[[https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking/home/welcome][Model
     Thinking]]", which I used to prepare a lesson in a new course on
     "data modeling":

  5) *Reading with props:* Often, especially in computer science,
     writing about concepts, and making computations by hand, is not
     enough. I have to try stuff as I read[fn:5] using props. The
     props lead to interactive (digital) notes rather than static
     (analog) ones. Any additional medium that I use (e.g. mindmaps,
     wiki, post-its, presentation) takes me away from the text and
     offers additional distractions - hence, I must have a really good
     reason to do this. More often than not, this mode is a follow-up
     mode to deepen my knowledge and my familiarity with a
     topic[fn:6].

     For example, here are two pages from the book "[[http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/][Artificial
     Intelligence - a Modern Approach]]" (AIMA) and the corresponding
     "reading with props" notes in the Emacs editor.

  6) *Re-reading:* I often have to do this, because my memory is
     leaky. Re-reading is like skimming (1) except that I (should)
     know the text really well already and only need to remind myself
     of core content and issues. Some instructors require re-reading -
     e.g. Bjarne Stroustrup, for his [[https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html][introductory programming course]],
     writes that the student must read the section of the book
     relevant to a session both before and after the session. I think
     this is excellent advice, because the second reading often
     reveals additional issues, and can be much more pleasurable,
     since you should now have a much better understanding. Of course,
     this only works if the text is well written[fn:7].

  7) *What now?* For example, how can you know if you've "read well"?
     In my experience, there is only one way: you've got to be able to
     create problems for yourself and solve them. Start with small
     problems (extensions of the text) and then move on to bigger
     ones. A concrete example from my reading of the AIMA book are
     questions that I ask myself as I'm reading, and that are not
     answered in the text (or even mentioned), e.g. "When did the
     concept of 'intelligence' become common?", or What is
     "first-principles reasoning"? (The term was used but not
     explained) etc. These are almost glossary-type questions. For
     another book that I'm working through ([[https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html][on probability theory]]),
     I'm trying to work out answers to simple questions that are
     extensions of examples given in the text. Also, if you are ever
     in a situation to teach, or even instruct, others on anything you
     learnt (which is likely if you are in a leadership role), this
     ability to construct assignments and exercises for practice will
     come in very handy. Caveat: this activity takes much longer than
     even "reading with notes" - in my case, I sometimes spend an
     entire day devising problems and trying to solve them, when the
     reading and note-taking only took me an hour!

* How to read more research papers?

  The title comes from [[https://www.louisbouchard.ai/research-papers/][this article]] by Louis Bouchard (23 June
  2021)[fn:9]. It's useful and you should all read it and take from it what
  you want. Here, I'm offering a few comments, organized by the
  different stages addressed in the article.

  First of all, the problem: a lot is published on any topic under the
  sun, and a lot more if the topic is trendy - like machine
  learning. This is both good and bad news. The good news: many
  publications means that the respective field is evolving fast,
  attracting the best people, research money, and generating a market
  (for products and people). The bad news: more and more publications
  remain essentially unchecked and unread; many of these papers are
  badly written, many are wrong, some are fraudulent even. There is so
  much pressure on the publication pipeline that hundreds, or
  thousands of papers are rushing past you in the blink of an eye.

  There are several questions resulting from this problem: (1) how to find
  the best papers? (2) How to find the papers that are right for you? 

  The article mentioned only addresses the second question in
  detail. The first question is touched upon in a paragraph on bias
  and trustworthiness at the end. In short: don't trust anyone until
  you've checked the results yourselves[fn:10]. 

  The author's answer to the first question is based on a series of
  software tools that can support your search. I only knew 2 of these
  (Arxiv Sanity Preserver and Zotero).

  Missing: conference reports via the relevant conferences, especially
  literature reviews, and [[https://www.kcu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Google-Scholar-Alert.pdf][Google scholar alerts]]. E.g. I have an alert
  out for every one of my current courses and research interests. It
  is connected with [[https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Vvnwsv0AAAAJ][my Google Scholar profile]].

  The final advice is excellent: you only get better at reading papers
  by reading papers! 

* Footnotes

[fn:10]There's something else worth noticing: this article, as most
articles on the web, are written by self starters and by independent
students or scholars. Nothing wrong with that but if you're lucky
enough to study at an institution, you can use experts around you to
find out about the best papers. These experts act like curators. For
example, I scan a lot of literature and will often pass interesting
articles on to you - like this one!

[fn:9]I received this online publication because I am subscribed to an
aggregator service. If you're not subscribed, you only have a limited
number of articles that you can view for free.

[fn:8]I do this in Emacs using [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]], a text-based user interface to
Git.

[fn:7]About that: most texts are not well written. Students often
feel it but don't know it for sure - but if a text does not speak to
you even though you honestly want to learn, it is more likely the
fault of its author. Or it could be that you need to read it not on a
digital device - I e.g. need to read mathematical texts on paper - I
cannot follow when I only see it displayed on a screen. If you cannot
find a well written text, try to write one yourself! Many excellent
books by excellent people were created that way (I should cite
examples here, but this is anecdotal knowledge - I should look it up,
or you could look it up and let me know).

[fn:6]Though in the case of the abovementioned online course, the
reason is that the course is quite boring, so I use the props to keep
myself entertained. If coding is not entertaining to you, something
else may be, e.g. making mindmaps or recording a log of what you
learnt, or doodling.

[fn:5]For the abovementioned online course on basic probability using
R, I fired up my R program and type examples into the console as I
listen to the lecture, and when I summarize it. If I work out a
lecture, I use my trusty Emacs editor to write an Org-mode file, which
includes code chunks, a concept and a code summary.

[fn:4]It doesn't have to be rocket science: recently, I took an online
course on basic probability. Since I had not looked at the material
for a long time, I had lost all mathematical intuition, and I had to
write down every example mentioned in the instruction video, to
recover at least some of it.

[fn:1]This is a principle of utility, which you will recognize as a
guiding principle for AI, especially for autonomous agents. Even if
you don't subscribe to it, you need to understand it.

[fn:3]I don't know about your attention span, but my attention span is
atrociously short: I always have so much running through my mind that
I am easily off on another thought-road. They say that this has to do
with the increasing use of digital tools and the web etc. but I think
it is much more down to individual psychology, constitution, or brain
chemistry. In any case: it's not an bug, but a feature! As always when
you identify one of your features, you should think about making best
use of it. Short attention span, for example, requires you to impose
structure and discipline on your learning plan and your day. And more
than that, it doesn't only distract you but it also re-orients you
quickly, so you're probably able to deal with more stimulation than
other people.

[fn:2]For example, as I am writing this, I'm watching "[[https://techtv.mit.edu/videos/10268-the-thinking-machine-1961---mit-centennial-film][The Thinking
Machine]]" (53 min. 1961). It's fascinating, but as I'm skimming
(i.e. listening to the first few minutes, looking at reviews ([[https://www.fastcompany.com/90399709/to-understand-ai-in-2019-watch-this-1960-tv-show][like
this one from 2019]]) or secondary sources to validate the content (who
are the authors? Whom does this text serve? When was it written? Where
was it published?), and going to two or three places in the film (to
see if the initial quality holds), I realize that I will have to dive
more deeply into this material - the equivalent of reading type (4)
where I take notes, jot down questions and my own ideas, perhaps even
branch into (5) and use a prop like a mindmap. If I go there or not
will depend on a number of factors: time available, alternative
sources, my mood, the weather, other priorities, etc.
